			<h2>Week1</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">In this week communication design class, the most persuasive argument introduced is how some details in a website can effect the quality of a website. This weeks classwork relate to our daily life since the Internet is now all over us, and it is important to determine weather a website is good or bad. There is nothing that I disagree in class this week, since the good and bad of a website is really easy to see. The most important point concept or concept this week will be the feature on how to create a website, such as the balance or color uses in the website. If I can redo this week concept, I will probably think more about the rubric details and how will the website be graded.</p>
		
			<h2>Week2</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">The most persuasive and convincing argument that introduced this week was the uses for HTML. People visits website everyday, however, we don’t know how the web page are made of. HTML shows the detail of how the website was created by using it languages on the web. The most important thing that relates to me in class or the reading this week is the basic color, color uses for color blind, and HTML. Color on the webpage can determine either the website are good or bad. However, there is nothing that I disagree about this weekend because I’m personally are new to HTML. The most important thing that we learned this week was basic details and the rules of HTML since it is important to create a good website. If I could do this weekend all over again I will like to redo the HTML practice and pay more attention on the detail or even remember it since it is really useful for the future as well. </p>
		
			<h2>Week3</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">In this week’s communication design class, we organize a school website first by hand, and organized each title on the website into groups. Later, we also design what our home page may be like. However, the most persuasive argument that introduce in this week’s class is the importance of organizing the webpage carefully and well. This is also the most relate to me in this week’s class, the reason is that the structure and organize of the webpage affect the viewer’s view. The reading is about how we can design our webpage in an organize way, as we follow the steps from the reading, we can organize a webpage better. In class, we also use HTML to create a school web page, and set many links to many different titles. This is important because it gives the understanding of how a title in a webpage is connected. If I could redo this week’s class over again more successfully, I would pay more attention on the details in HTML, the reason is that sometimes I am still confuse on the format of html. This week’s HTML process is hard since we have to make many connections for each title.</p>
		
			<h2>Week4</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">This week’s class we begin to design our webpage we organized last week. The most persuasive argument that I learned is the importance of closing in HTML 5, even though it is basic, but sometimes it is still easy to forget. Without the closing, HTML 5 won’t work. The most relate to me in the class is the connection between the categories in a website because most of the website that I used today have connection to other pages. It is really cool to see how a website connection is created. I think the most important concept this week is the “order list,” “unordered list, “ and “skip the content.” The reason is to be able list the important things on the website with orderly organized If I can do this week’s class again more successfully, I will rewrite the HTML 5 and put the content in more organized way and be more carful in details </p>
		
			<h2>Week5</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">In this weeks’ communication design class, we learned about how to create a chart by using HTML 5. The most persuasive or convincing argument in this week’s class is the usage between the “title” tag and the “h1” tag. I sometimes confuse about the differences between these two. Since both of these tags are use for title, however, only the “h1” tag will show your title on the webpage. The most relate to me this week’s class is the chart we created on the HTML 5. I saw the chart on the website very often which it is really interesting to see how it is created. I was really shocked how confusing it is to make a chart on the HTML 5. The most important concept the were communicate in this week’s class in the table style, rowspan and colspan because without these concept, the chart cannot be make. If I can redo this week more successfully, I will recreate the chart with more organized HTML.</p>
		
			<h2>Week6</h2>
				<p style="text-align:left">In this week’s communication design class, we were introducing to the project that we are going to work on for this week and next week. The project is to design a website for our journal entry. The most persuasive or argument that introduced in this week’s class is the importance of drawing a sketch for the website before creating one. It is easier to have a sample while making a website. The most relate class work in this week’s class is the project that we have to create. We have to apply everything that we learned for the last 5 weeks in one assignment, which is really challenging. There is nothing I really disagreed this week’s since we are making our own project most of the time. The most important point for this week is that we have to insert few picture in to the website which I have to use the code “img.” If I can redo this week over again more successfully is to redo my assignment with more organized HTML5 and pay attention to every steps that were introduced.</p>
            <h2>Week7</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left">In this week's communication design class, we were working our Journal project. The most persuasive argument that introduced in this week's class is making a table by myslef. It is confusing at first, however, later become more easier as I get more used to it with the code. The table is really useful for my "nav" code and for organizing the website. The most related class work is the Journal project because it applied to all the work from the previous classes. There is nothing i really disagreed in this week's class becasue we are working our own project most of the time. The most important thing that I found in this week's class it the table as well. Since we have not learn CSS yet, tables can help us to organize our website's layout. If I can redo this week's class over again more successfully, I will try my best to organized my code for the table more clearly. </p>
            <h2>Week8</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left">In this week's communication design class, we were introduce to CSS. The most persuasive argument that introduced in this week's class is how CSS is more organize and simple than Style. Before we learn CSS, we have to enter everything that we want to change in "style" everytime which sometimes can be really complicated. The most relate class work is to use CSS to change things on the portfolio webpage in the prvious unite. I can see how CSS make the work more organize and simple. There is nothing I disagree with becasue I am new to CSS coding. The most important thing is to organnize CSS code in order, and becareful with it. If I can redo this week's class over again,I will pay more attention on CSS, so next time I won't have to ask my classmates for more detail information.</p>
            <h2>Week9</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left">In this week's commnuication design class, we were working on CSS, we work in more details with CSS by adding many different features, we aslo work on the self study assignment of the University of Washington. The most persuasive argument that were introdeuced in this week's class is from the University of Washington. To know how to determine a website with good CSS dsign or not, such as the size of text and space of the website.This is also the most related class work because we sometimes see bad website on the internet and we don't want to make the same mistakes. There is nothing I disagree in this week's class becasue I'm not really familiar with the CSS. If I can redo this week's class over again, I will want to redo the assignment from the University of Washignton to make it better. </p>
            <h2>Week10</h2> 
		        <p style= "text-align:left">In this week's communication design class, we were continuing working on the Unite 3 on the University of Washington. The most persuasive argument that were introduced in this week's class is the size of border, margin, and padding. Enable to make a good website, the right size for your webpage is really important, it affect the way the website looks. This is also the most related class work becasue I often saw websites with feature that used CSS. There is nothing I disagree with in this week's class because we are working on self study of the University of Washington. If I can dedo this week's class, I will try to made my portfolio website looks better with bright color and made it more organize.</p>
            <h2>Week11</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left">In this week's communication design ckass, we tried to used CSS to recreate a HAS website. The most persuasive argument that were introduced in this week's class is that when your design your webpage, using CSS is more organize than using graph. However, CSS is more harder than just making a graph, it is more complicated. The most relate class work is that we applied our knowledge on CSS to recreate a webpage, eventhough I had difficulties while making the website. There is nothing I disagree with in this week's class. If I can redo this week's class again, I wish I can be more clear on the details of the coding and be able to create a webpage without other people's help.</p>
            <h2>Week12</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left">In this week's communication design class, we were introduced to many new features in CSS. The most persuasive argument of this week's class is the more indepth of the CSS, such as the .right code and .left features, with this features, making a graph in your website become more convinent. This is also the most relative class work to me, as I recreat the semanic.jpg, the things that we learned during the class is really helpful. However, I do not have any disagreement is this week's class, becasue I am not familiar with the CSS. If I can redo this week's class, I Will redo the semantic.jpg assignment with more attention and added more features to make my code more similar to the picture.</p>
