              <br /> This week, instead of studying lessons by lessons ourselves, we followed Mr. Fig's step
              on the HTML summary files. I found this really important and helpful because it reminded me of what
              I have been learning in this course, as well as learning some new things while we are doing as the teacher
              shows. As going further and further on Codecademy, I found it to be more and more interesting.
              Last week, I learned a lot of different attributes, ex, color, font-size, font-family, etc.,
              and these are being used a lot this week as well. What I learned was new from this week Codecademy was
              mainly about creating a table. First, Mr. Fig has shown us how to create a table properly, then he gave us
              a graphic of a table and told us to create it ourselves. I found it to be very challenging when Mr. Fig was
              showing us, and I was very surprised but proud at the same time that I actually created the table out successfully.
               I feel like I'm getting more and more familiar with all the tags and attributes. But I really hope I can
               remember them all through practices because it's such a hard thing to do in such a short time. I feel like I have
              done this week pretty awesome, so I wouldn't want to do this week over again.</td>
