               <br />This week we began to further develop on HTML while last week, it was more like an introduction
              to HTML. We learned what HTML was and how it has developed throughout the time. We were introduced to
              different versions of HTML as well. This week, we actually started to work on HTML.

              The most important and interesting thing I learned was how to HTML and Notepad++ to begin designing
              your own website. We started the week by grouping to different categories and subcategories. I didn't think
               it was so difficult until I started to actually do it. It was quite confusing at some points, and our group
              ended up to have 9 different categories.

              It began to be a lot more interesting when we got to start working on our own website.
              I was amazed by how we could really create a web page even when it was all blank at first.
              And as we started coding with Notepad++, it became even more amazing. It was much harder than how it looked.
               We have been working for the whole block, but at the end, the web page still looked plain and boring.
               But overall, I think it was worth it because I have never learned about anything like that,
               and I found it to be very interesting to me.

               If I could do this week over again, I would have concentrated more when we were dividing
               all the categories up, so I would be more familiar with the materials when we actually started
               to code our own web page.</td>

          <td  height=300 style="text-align:center;border:3px solid #AF7AC5;width:50%">Week 4
          <br /> This week we began to further develop on our index.html file. It was a lot of work but I actually
          found it pretty interesting. The most important and interesting thing that I learned was actually about the
          ordered lists, unordered lists, font-size, font-family, color, etc. I learned most of these in Codecadamy and
          I found it not too challenging but very fun.  As I said last week, the course began to be a lot more
          interesting when we got to start working on our own website. Now during most of the class time,
          instead of the teacher lecturing, we have been having classes as we are self studying. We each follow
          our own pace and we learn things by reading passages and by practicing. I actually liked it a lot a lot.
          I actually like how we are being taught and what we are learning. I feel like it is indeed a better way for
          students to study own their own and can ask the teacher questions whenever they are confused by the materials.
          I hope we can continue doing this further on in this course. If I could do this week over again, the only
          thing that I would do differently is probably to do everything faster so I can move on the further units or
          lessons in this course. Other than that, I feel like this week was quite an wonderful week because I have
          learned some interesting stuff and I enjoyed it.</td>

              <br />This week, instead of studying lessons by lessons ourselves, we followed Mr. Fig's step
              on the HTML summary files. I found this really important and helpful because it reminded me of what
              I have been learning in this course, as well as learning some new things while we are doing as the
              teacher shows. As going further and further on Codecademy, I found it to be more and more interesting.
              Last week, I learned a lot of different attributes, ex, color, font-size, font-family, etc.,
              and these are being used a lot this week as well. What I learned was new from this week Codecademy
              was mainly about creating a table. First, Mr. Fig has shown us how to create a table properly,
              then he gave us a graphic of a table and told us to create it ourselves. I found it to be very challenging
               when Mr. Fig was showing us, and I was very surprised but proud at the same time that I actually created
               the table out successfully. I feel like I'm getting more and more familiar with all the tags and
               attributes. But I really hope I can remember them all through practices because it's such a hard thing
               to do in such a short time. I feel like I have done this week pretty awesome, so I wouldn't want to do
               this week over again. </td>

          <td  height=300 style="text-align:center;border:3px solid #AF7AC5;width:50%">Week 6
            <br /> This week we didn't really learn anything new. This week we bagan to do our very first project.
            In this project, we suppose to show what we have learnt in this course and use them properly by creating our
            own webpage. That was quite exciting for me actually because I have never made a webpage myself before and that was
            my first time doing so. In order to create our own personal webpage, we first came up with a website plan, which contains
            a homepage sketch. I hand drew a sketch that showed a general layout of my website's homepage, the navigational links,
            and the main content. Next, I also hand drew a website structure that presented my website's navigational structure.
            Then I did the folder structure which I didn't really need to put much effort in it. The next thing I will be doing will
            be coding which is the painful part. I have never taken computer science before so everything about coding is new to me.
            Although HTML is much easier than actaul computer coding, but it is for sure challenging enough for me personally.
            I will probably start all the HTML code next week, and hopefully I will use all the materials I have learnt
            in the course, and be able to use them correctly. So far, I pretty much enjoy everything I have learnt and
            I just want to dig out more stuff about designing my own webpage. Again,I feel like I have done this week pretty awesome,
            so I wouldn't want to do this week over again.
