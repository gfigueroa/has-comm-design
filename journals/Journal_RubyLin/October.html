               <br />This week was all about the first project, creating and designing our own webpage. What I did first was
               creating three seperate pages on my navigation menu, which are home page, journal entry page, and contact page. On
               each page, since we haven't learned anything about CSS, I had to use tables to creat my layouts of each page.
               So on the first page, which is the home page, I introduced briefly about myself and this course, and also put some
               related images on the sides as well. On the second page, jounal entry page, I put all of my journal entries on import
               and organized it by weeks. On the last page, the contact page, I simply put on ways to contact me and different pink icons
               for each media. On each page, I use the same background and only use different tones of purple and pink on all the texts and
               images. This project is a bit hard for me, I had so many confusions and obstacles when I was doing it. Thankfully, I
               had helps from my classmates and the teacher to help me out. I can't wait to jump into the CSS part, because I
               would like to learn more about web designing and creating my own distinct webpage. I have already done the unit four and
               five on Codecademy, so I believe I already had some CSS base knowledge for further usage. If I woulc to do this week over agin,
               I would probably start all the HTML coding thing ealier, so I would have more time to brainstorm and design my
               webpage.

          <br /> This week we reviewed a few CSS things during class time with the teacher. Selectors, properties and values
          are the three main things we reviewed on. During class, we kept practicing using different selectors, properties and
          values. Those are just the fundations of CSS. I was really amazed by what we can do with CSS when I was first
          introduced to it on Codecademy. It is so efficient and convinient to use. We no longer we to style each attribute
          individually. Now we can simply go to the stylesheet.css and style them their. Everything becomes so easy and simple
          to do. This weekend, our homework is to do more CSS practice on Codecademy, and I have learned a lot more about
          CSS after finishing Unit 6. I now know about things like position, disply, margin, negative space and so on.
          Although I have learned a lot more about CSS now, I am still not completely sure on how to use each selector.
          Some of the selectors are quite confusing to me, and I'm not really sure how to use it when coding CSS. I hope
          I can get a clearer sense on each of them in the upcoming week along with some practices  and
          instructions that the teacher will give.  I feel like I have done this week pretty decently so I would
          not want to do this week over again.

        <br /> This week, we continued doing practices on CSS. I really think CSS makes everything about styling a webpage
        so so much easier. We can do all the styling and designs on the styles sheet and all the different files can
        share the same stylesheet as long as we connect the links to it. This week, we confused on doing online practices
        by ourselves on the University of Washington website. We further develop on the use of CSS and be more familiar
        at it. Practices and activities we did on the University of Washington website are not so challenging for me,
        because almost all of them are the things we have already learned and done on the Codecademy. Therefore, Comm. Design
        as a course is no longer that challenging for me and I appreciate the fact that I indeed start to enjoy coding
        a lot more as we move on in this course. This week, we also did some evaluations on our peer's project. I found a
        lot of projects to be facinating. A lot of them did things that I didn't think of and a lot of their designs
        are very creative. By seeing other poeple's work help me realize what my weaknesses and strengths are and now
        I'm sure that I will do better in future projects. As I said last week, I feel like I have done this week pretty
        decently so I would not want to do this week over again.
