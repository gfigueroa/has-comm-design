               <br /> This week we mainly worked on Unit 3 on University of Washington website. In Unit 3, we learned about basic introductions of CSS,
               such as color, typography, the box model, the role of ID and Class in CSS. Other than that,
               it also covered page laypur techniques and as usual, having a reflection
               at the end. The easiest material is the color in CSS. In this module, we only need to revist the color theory that we learned about in previous
               lessons and apply it when selecting an appropriate color scheme for websites. The most challenging module 4: The
               Box Model in CSS. It's challenging to me because it's very complicated and you actually
               need to continuesly practice applying it to your style sheet in order to understand it, and
               be familiar to it as well. The reason why I said it's complicated is because there are many
               selectors that I need to remember, and each of them have different purpose. The content us wrapped inside
               a "box" that is made up of padding, borders, and margins. By stylizing these properties using CSS, we can
               create more space between elements on the page and attain interesting styles that help to distinguish
               different sections of the page, which I found condusing sometimes. But as I practice more in mytext editor,
               I kind of get more familiar and better at it. As I said last week, I feel like I wouldn't want to do this week
               over again.

          <br /> This week we only have two classes and I was absent for the frist class because I wasn't feeling well.
          Mr. Kruger subbed for the class and the whole class worked on creating a HAS website page using CSS. When I went back
          to class on Thurday, I didn't know what to do. I practiceing all the units on Codecademy on CSS, however, I still
          think it's pretty challegning. By doing all the CSS coding stuff, I see how it is sometimes easier and more ocnvinient
          than coding in HTML, but I found it sometimes to be more confusing when I am not familiar with the selectors.
          The most challenging and confusing part in coding with CSS will be the box model. It's always difficult for me
          to use margin, border, and padding easily or correctly. It bothers me a lot when I get confused by which one out of margin
          border, and padding I should really use in different cases. Also, sometimes after I figured out which one I should use, I
          then get troubled by what pixels should I put in? For most of the time, I would need to try different pixels for a couple of times
          before I make it into the right size or space. I think I would definitely need more practice and help from
          the teacher in order to get really familiar and skilled at using CSS. If I would to do this week again,
          I hope I was not sick on the first class of this week, so I wouldn't miss out so much and be this behind
          on creating the HAS website.

          <br /> This week, Mr. Fig continues the cource with CSS. We created another page in "Learning CSS",
          called "contact.html" and a new stylesheet linked to that called "contact_stylesheet.css". In "contact_stylesheet.css"
          we further developed on CSS as in we pratice more and more on the usage of CSS, especially on margin, border, and
          padding. For the page "contact.html", we praciticed quite a lot on using classes and IDs.
          Those are also something that I am not so familiar with when coding using CSS. Last week, I said in the Journal that
          I am especially not confident when it comes to eithe margin, border or padding. And this week on the "contact.html" page,
          the teacher has shown us a lot of times of how to use those properties. Besides that, he also showed a
          how to use properties like "position", "backrground-color", "text-align","width", "float", etc. Through multiple
          practices, I think I have been more familiar but yet not good enough to be condifent and skilled at it. Properties
          that I am espeically confused with are like "text-width" and "z-index". Moreover, the teacher finished teaching CSS this
          week, and gave us an assigment where we need to create a samentic table using CSS skills. That really really troubled me.
          I don't know why I am still not capable to easily use CSS even with this many practices. I feel like I have tried my best
          this week on my performances, therefore, I wouldn't want to do this week again.
