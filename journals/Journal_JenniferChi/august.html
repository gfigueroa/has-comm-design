			 This week, we discussed the qualities that a good website would have. Although, I don't think 
				 I really learned anything because most of the qualities we learned about were based off of common 
				 sense and opinion. Some of the qualities included were design, navigation and communication of the 
				 website. I think the most important thing we discussed this week were the qualities of a bad website. 
				 This included whether the website was disorganized, too cluttered, unappealing, etc. I think everyone 
				 knows what a "good" website looks like (organized, easy to navigate, well designed), but we don't really 
				 consider the qualities of a bad website. We only know that it looks bad. So, I think it was good that we 
				 verbally expressed what made a bad website a bad website. However, I think that everyone in the class all 
				 had similar ideas of what a good and bad website looked like, so there was no disagreement anywhere.
