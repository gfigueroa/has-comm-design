		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 2 (9/4/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we were able to see what a combined grading rubric for a good website looked like. We also learned, 
				in some detail, about coding basics for HTML and the qualities that make a up a website and how to utilize them (such as color).
				<br /> 
				<br /> I especially liked being able to learn a little about how top code on HTML because it was the most interesting and beneficial 
				thing we've learned in the past two weeks. Learning how to code HTML ensures that you are able to organize your website in the 
				way that you imagined. It also allows for you to have complete control over what happens on your website which I think is the most 
				important because if you are creating a website, individuality would be the most important to you.  However, learning about the different 
				kind of colorblindness and how to best counter that on a website was also helpful to learn about because whatever website you create, there 
				are bound to be a few colorblind people who will appreciate the extra effort you put into making sure that they could see the color as well.
				<br /> 
				<br />I don't think I can relate to the feeling of being colorblind and going on a website that wasn't catered toward colorblind people, but I can 
				imagine that it feels like you're being left out of something important. Because, while others can see all the colors on any website, it would be 
				impossible for you to see all those colors. So, if a colorblind person came across a colorblind-catered website, I would imagine that it feels 
				good to be taken into account.
				<br /> 
				<br />If I could do this week over again, I would like to have paid more attention to the other lessons we read about, particularly the information 
				on color contrast and anything to do with color because I feel that the first thing people notice on a website are the colors. If you have horrible 
				coloring, people's thoughts of your website will instantly turn negative. While if you have good coloring, people's thoughts of your website turn 
				instantly positive.

		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 3 (9/11/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we learned about how to organize a website based on categories and subcategories. We also learned a little bit more about how to 
				use HTML, how to use Notepad++ and began thinking of ideas for how our own website will be designed.
				<br />
				<br />I think the most interesting thing we learned this week was how to organize the categories inside websites. For example, we were given a 
				certain amount of "cards" with a different subject on each one and we had to organize them and give them titles by how we felt they should be 
				grouped. I think this was helpful because while categorizing can seem easy, it was helpful to physically group certain categories and see how 
				they were related to each other. I think this type of organizational skill will be helpful when we actually begin making out own website and 
				have to figure out where everything goes.
				<br />
				<br />I think the most important thing we learned this week was how to begin coding a website with Notepad++ (I think that's what it's called). 
				We entered code for how to insert links and them as files so when we click on them it would actually take us to an empty site. We also learned 
				how to add the hyperlinked categories, so when you clicked on them it would lead you straight back to the homepage. I think it as pretty cool 
				to see how a website is actually made. It's a lot more work than it looks like. I think this is the most important because this like the foundation 
				for a website. If we didn't know how to do this then we couldn't even begin making a website.
				<br />
				<br />If I could do this week over again, then I would want to redo the category organizing activity because I would want to organize it in a more 
				efficient way. Our group ended up with nine categories, but I think we could have lowered that number by combing some of the categories that 
				we made into one.

		<h2 style="font-size:25px">Week 4 (9/18/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size:20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we learned how to further create our own website by adding a navigation menu, links, and lists. We also learned how to change 
				the font, font-size, and color of our text (in Codecademy). In our additional homework, we also learned the qualities to make any website 
				accessible to anyone.
				<br />
				<br />The most interesting thing I thought we learned this week was how to make our website accessible to people who were disabled. I never 
				really thought that a website could be restricting for people who had disabilities. So, it was really an eye-opener to learn the struggles 
				that some people have to go through just to view a website. I thought it was helpful that we also learned how to fix those problems. 
				For example, for the blind, we have to make sure that there is an option for the user to skip the navigation page so that their screen 
				reader won't have to go through all that information.
				<br />
				<br />I think the most important thing we learned this week was how to further code our website using HTML because this helped us to further 
				create the "skeleton" of our website. In our code, we were able to create a navigation bar and links that led to different sites on the 
				navigation bar. We also learned how to create an introduction to ourselves using. These are important because they make sure that 
				our site is organized instead of messy.
				<br />
				<br />In the future, I am excited to learn about how to code in CSS. I know that CSS is like "skin and makeup" of a website. SO, I'm interested 
				to learn how we can implement these qualities into our site to make it more appealing.

		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 5 (9/25/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we worked more on our portfolio website. We learned how to code more things in HTML like how to add tables and how to add 
				specific designs (ex. color and font) to the typing. We learned how to code these things through two methods: the first was was through 
				the Washington website and the second through the help of Mr. Figueroa.
				<br />
				<br />The most important thing we learned this week was how to do more coding with HTML. Because coding is what makes up almost all 
				of a website, it is important that we know how to do the most basic things. For example, we learned how to add more details to our text. 
				I think this is pretty important because the text not to only conveys the information that needs to be conveyed but it also makes your 
				website more appealing. If your website ha one font and one font color throughout, people won't be interested in it. But if your website 
				has a adequate amount of differentiation in terms of text, the reader will stay interested. We also learned about how to code tables, 
				but I think this wasn't as important because I don't think tables are used as often as text unless you're trying to show data.
				<br />
				<br />This week, we learned how to code by watching what Mr. Figueroa typed on the board and then copying it down. I didn't like this 
				method because it got boring just looking up at the screen and copying it onto out computer. Also, sometimes I would get confused on what 
				to do, but by the time I figured it out, the class would already be ahead of me. I preferred when we go to self learn it because I got to 
				go at my own pace and if I had questions I could ask them without being left behind. Also, I think it helps to self learn coding more because 
				then we get to do everything ourselves which makes it easier to learn.
