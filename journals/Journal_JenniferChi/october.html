		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 6 (10/2/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we didn't really learn anything new, but we began working on our first project. For our first project, 
				we have to create and code our own website that will be used for our journal entries.
				<br />
				<br />I think this will be an interesting and insightful project. I've never created my own website before, so 
				it'll be interesting to see how it turns out and how I'm going to actually make it. Also, I think this will be 
				good practice on how to create a good website because we've learned all the necessities in class and now we just 
				have to put them to good use.
				<br />
				<br />I think it's important to know the steps to creating a good website, which is what we have learned. 
				And our project will help us to hone those skills. For our project, we first create  an idea of what our website 
				is going to look like and draw it out. Then we so the actual coding. The steps aren't that complicated, but I think 
				the hardest part for me will be creating the code. I'm not good at coding from scratch. I usually need some sort of 
				guidance or starting point otherwise I'll be lost. So, I hope this project will help me in coding. However, I do have 
				the previous codes that we have done, so that'll help a bunch.

		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 7 (10/9/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we didn't learn anything new. We just continued to work on our websites. 
				<br />
				<br />As you can tell, I finished my website and I think I did a decnet job on it I actually really enjoyed this project 
				because I got to do everyting myself from the very beginning. Of course, I had some places where I was stuck and didn't know what 
				to do, so I asked a few questions. But other than that, I did everything myself. At first, I thought this project was going to 
				be really hard and kind of boring, but I was wrong. It was actually really enjoyable to create my own website. And it wasn't as hard 
				as I thought it was going to be because we had already learned everything. 
				<br />
				<br />I think this project allowed me to hone my coding skills. There were some topics in coding that I was unsure of or couldn't remember
				how to do, but I think this project really helped with that. I think the hardest part was how to begin creating the website. Like, I didn't 
				know what page to start with or how to begin coding, but once I got the hang of it, it was really easy. 
				<br />
				<br />I think the most important thing I learned with this project was how to begin that process of creating a website. The beginning 
				process of anything is always hard for me, so I think this project really helped me with that. I also think this project helped give me 
				an idea of the time and effort it takest to create a website. I now have a better understanding and appreciation of it.

		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 8 (10/16/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we were able to begin learning how to code in CSS. Before, we had kind of learned how to CSS code through Codecademy. But this week,
				we got to use our knowledge in class to create some basic codes. We learned how to code background-color, width, height, and other things that would make 
				a website more attractive. We also learned the names of ites in CSS like "selector" and "value". 
				<br />
				<br /> I think learning CSS will be very helpful in the future when making websites because it seemed a lot easier than having to code everything in HTML
				With CSS, we wouldn't have to type out every tag and could, instead, go to the CSS file and type out everything efficiently. I don't much like coding, 
				especially when we have to type out every detail over and over again. But with CSS, those deatils are easy to type. Also, the thing I like about CSS is that 
				we are able to do more with the website. For example, if I want to make a website more colorful or more vidual-friendly, all I have to do is go to the CSS code
				and input a few things. CSS is the "skin and makeup" of a website which I think is very true because learning how to code in CSS is like adding the finishing touches
				to a website. 
				<br />
				<br />If I could do this week over again, I would have wanted to pay more attention to the technical stuff that we learned in class. Like what the names of certain things 
				were or how to code more efficiently. Sometimes I zone out during class because it's the end of the day and I get really tired. So, next week, I hope I am able to 
				listen and pay attention more.

		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 9 (10/23/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we continued to learn about CSS and how to code in CSS. We went over the basics of how to decorate a webpage using CSS. We also learned about the box 
				model and how the box model worked. We incorporated that knowledge into CSS. Then, for most of the week, we worked on the activties in Unit 3 of the Washington 
				website. 					
				<br />
				<br /> I think the Unit 3 activties were the most important thing we did this week. While we didn't get to finish Unit 3 this week, I think it helps to do some of
				the CSS coding ourselves instead of just copying off the board the while time. I think copying off the board when coding is when we are introduced to a new topic, but
				afterwards I find it better when we get to work on activities ourselves. For me, I work better when I get to use the knowledge I earned on my own instead of having 
				someone guide me the whole time. I find that, working on my own, makes it easier for me to understand the process and why we do certain things in coding. 
				<br />		
				<br /> Next week, I hope we get to learn how to code more things in CSS instead of focusing on the basics that we already know. By the end of this lesson, I would like
				to be able to make my webite a little more fancier because right now, I don't really like the format of it. I think I like coding in CSS more than coding in HTML
				because I find it simpler to use even though HTML and CSS are kind of similar. 
			</p>
		
		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 10 (10/30/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we continued to work of our Unit 3 website project. In the project, we had to add more onto our portfolio website using both CSS and HTML. Unit 3 consisted
				of an introduction to CSS, how to code in CSS, such as color and typography, and how to create a good page layout. Most of the things in Unit 3 was stuff that we has already 
				learnined. But I found that this project was a good review of how to code in CSS. I think it was really helpful to be able to create the webite on our own, with a little 
				guidance from Mr. Figuroa and the website. 
				<br />
				<br />If I could do this week over again, I would've wanted to spend more time making my webite look a little prettier and more organized. I think I would have wanted to change
				the color scheme of my website because I used a lot of pink-based colors which I wish I would change to a different color. I think I rushed my website a little because I wanted
				to finish the project as soon as possible because I knew it would be due soon. I also would've wanted to better layout my website. I was having a few difficulties with figuring 
				out how to code the layout of my website and I wish I could've done more with the layout. I couldn't figure out how to get my navigation links to align horizontally and it
				really frustrated me. 
				<br />
				<br /> But, overall, I'm proud that I finished it because it took me a while to do. Also, it will have been my second website that I have made, including this one. Next week, 
				I hope that we are able to learn how to refine our website building skills because my skills now are at an amateur level and I would like to make my wensites look as majestic 
				as possible.
