		<h2 style="font-sixe:35px">Week 11 (11/6/16)</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;border:1px solid black">
				This week, we had one assignment. That assignment was to recreate a website that was given to us bu using HTML and CSS. We started the assignment on Monday, continued
				working on Wednesday, and finished on Friday. Although, I didn't get to really finish my assignment. I found teh assignment to be quite challenging because, at first 
				I had no idea where to start. As I got the hang of it, everything kind of just fell into place. I think the most challenging parts were figuring out how to code the 
				layout. Even if you make one small mistake, which is hat happened to me, everything gets messed up and you have to do everything all over again. 
				<br />
				<br /> The most important thing I learned this week was how to work on a code by myself. I had help here and there, but I think most of it was my own indepent thought. 
				However, I think I only got about three quarters of the way done because I just couldn't figure out how to code certain parts. I think it would have been more beneficial 
				if Mr. Figuroa had been there to help us along when we were stuck. 
				<br />
				<br /> If I could do this week over again, I think I would want to approach my code in a different manner. I think I made my current code more complicated than i had to 
				be. I only did this because I couldn't figure out the how to code the layout of the page. I would want to be able to redo my code and make sure that I think more 
				about what I am doing in my code because I think it would've been more beneficial to future Jennifer.

			This week, added more onto our "Learning CSS" folder. We created a new HTML and CSS file in which we continued to learn how to properly format a page. We reviewed what 
			types of positions there were and what padding and margin was. Wr also started another one of our own assignments where we had to, once again, copy something from 
			the board by using the information we learned in class. I think these types of exercises, while boring, are hepful when you want to practice the information that we
			learned. It helps me refine my skills in CSS coding. 
			<br />
			<br /> I didn't learn anything new this week, but I liked being able to review the material that we had covered before because it helps me better understand and
			remember the material that we learned. However, the assignment was hard for me because it's hard for me to start something on my own without any guidance. But once 
			I got the hang of it, everything came a lot easier. 
			<br />
			<br /> In future classes, I hope that we'll be able to move onto another topic or learn more about the CSS properties in coding. While it is good to review, it gets
			kind of boring after a while. I also hope that we can do different activties because the activties that we're ding now are also kind of boring. But I understand
			that it's hard to find new activties to do for a class like this because what more is there to do?
