			In this week, we learned the rest position properties which were absolute 
			and relative. Position absolute was used when you wanted to adjust the position
			of an element based on the position of its parent tag; position relative was
			used when you wanted to adjust the position of an element based on its normal 
			position in the HTML. Position relative was similar to position static; 
			however, their biggest difference was that position relative could set top,
			bottom, left, and right, but position static could not. The thing I related 
			to the most was using position absolute. When using position absolute, it was 
			easier to move a chunk of text to anywhere on the web page. In addition, I 
			agreed with everything I learned this week, after understanding the function 
			of absolute and relative, it was a lot easier to move texts around. Moreover, 
			I thought the most important point communicated this week was using float. 
			Float was pretty useful when you wanted to put a paragraph right beside another 
			paragraph, and you did not want them to overlap. However, you had to use float 
			carefully, or it would mess up the whole structure of the website. Lastly, 
			if I could do this week over again more successfully, I would not change anything.
