			This week, we learned the position property and display property of CSS. 
			Position property includes absolute, relative, static, and fixed; display property 
			includes inline, inline-block, and block. We only learned position static 
			and fixed this week; static is usually the default setting and fixed means 
			"not move." For position property, we learned all of them; inline is usually 
			the default setting, inline-block is similar to inline but includes width and 
			height, and block is used to separate information into a different block. The 
			thing I related to the most was using position fixed. Position fixed was very 
			useful when creating a website with a navigation menu on top because then the 
			user would be easier to go back to the home page. I agreed with everything I 
			learned this week and I thought they were very useful. Additionally, I thought 
			the most important point communicated this week was using block. Display block 
			could be used to separate chunks of text without having to use break for every 
			new line, which was less time consuming. Lastly, if I could do this week over 
			again more successfully, I would not use float in my HAS Website because it 
			seemed to mess up everything.
