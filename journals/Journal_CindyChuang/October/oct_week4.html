			This week, we finished learning CSS on Washington Learning Website. 
			What we did this week were all about adjusting our webpage and playing 
			around with different properties. The thing I related to the most was using 
			float and border-radius. By using float, I could create a navigation menu 
			that looks like the one shown in the image below, which was more 
			professional and beautiful. Also, using border-radius could create a 
			round border around the navigation menu which made them look like 
			"bottoms." However, the use of float could cause certain problem. The 
			content could not be centered because everything was floated to the left, 
			and the webpage was asymmetrical. Futhermore, I thougth the most important point
			communicated this week was using different properties that could change 
			the way our webpages look. The more time you tried different properties,
			you would have more choices. Lastly, if I could do this week 
			over again more successfully, I would change my font color since it 
			was similar to the background color of my webpage, and could not really 
			stand out.
