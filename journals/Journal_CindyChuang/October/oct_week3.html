			This week, we learned some features about box and used them in our portfolio. 
			The thing I related to the most in class was using margin. Before learning 
			margin, I was unable to add space between text and the border of website, 
			which made my webpage looked messy. However, after using margin to create 
			space between text and text, everything looked more organized and information
			could be viewed clearly. Futhermore, I had to say that I disagreed with some 
			information in the reading. The Washington Learning Website required the user 
			to add padding, margin, border, background-color, and color to every 
			element(tag); nevertheless, I thought that using TOO much features could 
			make website looked unorganized. Therefore, I did not follow the 
			requirements. I thought the most important thing communicated this week 
			was using padding and margin. These two properties helped separating information 
			and creating appropriate distance between box and text. Lastly, if I could do 
			this week over again more successfully, I would not change anything.
