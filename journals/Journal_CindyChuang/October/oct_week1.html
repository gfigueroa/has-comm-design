			This week, we started to construct and design our own journal website. 
			The thing I related to the most in class was to jump between different 
			webpages. A convenient website should be easy to navigate, and it should 
			included a bottom that would guide the user back to the homepage or to 
			the previous page(I saw this in a lot of websites). In addition, I agreed 
			with everything in class. The teacher's suggestion for including a 
			navigation menu in every webpage was helpful since it could help the 
			users use the website more easily. I thought the most important point 
			communicated this week was to call a file that was outside a folder. It 
			was easy to call a file that was inside a folder; however, if you wanted 
			to call a file outside the folder, you have to add "../" before the 
			file name. Moreover, if I could do this week over again more successfully, 
			I would change my navigation menu a little bit because it might help 
			to raise the convenience of my website.
