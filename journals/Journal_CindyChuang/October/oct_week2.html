			This week, we learned some basic properties in CSS and how to create a style 
			sheet. The thing I related to the most in class was a property called "hover." 
			When using hover in our website, it helped make the webpage more professional, 
			and look more similar with the websites that we viewed on internet. 
			In addition, I strongly agreed with using CSS since it not only made 
			the web look prettier, but also saved a lot of time for keep copying 
			style properties and paste them on each tag. I thought that the most 
			important point communicated this week was to use a style sheet that could 
			store all the properties we wanted to add in our website. In this way, we 
			could keep our code organized and it would be easier to play around with 
			different properties. Moreover, if I could do this week over again more 
			successfully, I would make the font-family in my web portfolio consistent 
			because it would make my site look neater.
