			This week, we learned about how to judge whether a website is good or not, and we 
			identified some traits that make a website look well-organized. The thing I related 
			to the most in class was to create a rubric to score a website. I had seen a lot of 
			rubrics that graded many different things such as an essay or project, and by creating 
			a rubric ourselves, we could find out the characteristics that all good websites 
			should have. In addition, I thought the most important point communicated this week 
			was the different features of good and bad websites, and this explained why some websites 
			were well-designed and others not. Lastly, if I could do this week over again, 
			I would communicate more with my teammates and divide the work equally; thus, 
			no one would have to do extra work and everyone could participate.
