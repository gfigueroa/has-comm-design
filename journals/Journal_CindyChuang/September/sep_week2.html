			This week, we learned how to group similar information into a bigger 
			category and we had created a school website that contained several 
			categories. The thing that I related to the most was organizing different 
			information. I had seen a lot of websites, some of them grouped information 
			in an unclear way so people couldn't find what they need. However, some 
			of them grouped information in a methodical way that people could find what
			they need easily. Additionally, we had a group work on Tuesday in which 
			some of my teammates didn't agree with my idea. They believed that "Club"
			should be classified into the "Student" category, but I thought it should 
			be classified into the "Activity" category. When we disagreed with each 
			other, we explained our thoughts and each one take a turn to give in. I 
			thought the most important point communicated this week was the steps of 
			building a website and switching between different webpages (use &lt;nav&gt;). 
			Lastly, if I could do this week over again, I would change the way we 
			classified information because I felt like there were too many categories 
			which would make our webpages looked messy.
