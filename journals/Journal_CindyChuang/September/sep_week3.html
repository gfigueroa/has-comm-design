			This week, we learned how to construct our own Web Portfolio and to add more 
			contents and features in it. The thing I related to the most was building 
			a table. Before I learned HTML, I thought that building a table was like 
			building a chart in Word which was very easy. However, when I actually got 
			to build a table, I found it hard and required a lot of codes. I never thought 
			that I could write a bunch of codes to graph a "table"! In addition, for the 
			readings this week, I agreed with all of them since all of the readings taught 
			us how to build a website that could also benefit the people with disabilities. 
			Moreover, I thought the most important point communicated this week was to create 
			a list in our own webpage and to link from our webpage to another external 
			internet website. Learning how to create a list could make the site looked 
			more organized, and provided URL that linked to the other webpages could make 
			the site more convenient. Lastly, if I could do this week over again, I would 
			not change anything because I thought everything was successful, we followed
			all the instructions.
