			This week, we learned the history of HTML and how to use it to design a 
			webpage. The thing I related to the most in class is to create a 
			webpage and design it because I had seen a lot of websites before and 
			I never knew how to create one by myself until this week. Additionally, 
			I thought the most important point communicated this week is to code and
			design our own webpage. We got to learn how to move from one webpage to 
			another and finally move back to the homepage, and we tried different text 
			color and font size to see which combination made our webpage look the 
			best. Lastly, if I could do this week over again, I would try to change 
			the font size in my webpage to make it larger and clearer since I 
			thought my font size was a little bit too small.
