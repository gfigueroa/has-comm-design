			This week, we learned how to construct a table using colspan and rowspan, 
			and we created a summary about different types of tags used in HTML. 
			The thing I related to the most was actually creating a table that looked 
			almost the same as the image provided by the teacher. Even if I just wanted 
			to create a simple table with colors in it, I had to write a code and try it 
			several times in order to make the table looked "nice" and "neat". In 
			addition, I found that using colspan and rowspan could add more features 
			to a table, and they were useful when creating boxes with different sizes. 
			I agreed with everything I learned this week - different tags were used for 
			different content, for example, &lt;nav&gt; stores navigation, &lt;footer&gt;
			stores things at the bottom of the website, and &lt;article&gt; stores 
			the content. Lastly, I thought the most important point communicated this 
			week was using border. Using a border could make the table more 
			organized and looked more "professional". If I could do this week over 
			again, I would not change anything because this week was successful.
