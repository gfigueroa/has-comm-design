			<h2>Week 8</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					When we tried to convince the teacher to make the AC cooler<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					I related most to the people who were complaining about the temperature.<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					Yes, make the room cooler.<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					I think the most important thing was that we elaborated on css stylesheets: they're a pain<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					Not much, I caught up with my work and didn't really do anything I regret.<br>
