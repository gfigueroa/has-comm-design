			<h2>Week 4</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					We just coded things so... nothing.<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					We're doing more things that are related to design instead of just coding. Thats cool.<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					Nope. There were not a lot of positions taken and we didn't do a lot of reading.<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					We only had one class where we worked on our portfolio. That was it really.<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					Probably not be sick in class. It really kills productivity and your ability to focus on things. Why? Because no one likes being sick<br>
