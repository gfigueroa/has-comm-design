			<h2>Week 6</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					Nothing came up as an argument.<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					I didn't really relate to anyone<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					Nope<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					Everytime we elaborate on a code-related topic I think it's important.<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					I would not have missed class because once I do, I end up really behind and regretting it.<br>
