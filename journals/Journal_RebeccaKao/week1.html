			<h2>Week 1</h2>
			<p>
				a) Don't really think there was one. We didn't debate or argue about anything and nothing really stood out in the grand scheme of things.<br>
				b) Related most to how terrible the bad sites were. Unless its on purpose, hopefully no one ever makes a site like that thinking it's good.<br>
				c) No not really. Pretty much everyone agreed on what sites were good and aesthetic and what sites were plain terrible.<br>
				d) "How not to make a bad site" covers it. Although most people can already tell good from bad, the classes gave a more in-depth look on what exactly makes a site displeasing to the eye.<br>
				e) Not much tbh, there was nothing that I would fix - things went pretty well. Also its literally the first week and we didn't do a lot of things where we were free to do whatever. So no major choices to regret or change<br>
