			<h2>Week 2</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					We didn't really argue about anything.<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					The frustration of coding. Coding is sometimes easy but sometimes its hard to figure out what is wrong with your code, especially with a new language<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					Nope. Most of the positions and readings are factual and make sense.<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					We finally started to learn how to code in html. I'd say that thats the most important thing.<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					I wish I wasn't sick on Wednesday and had been able to go to class. Even though I probably didn't miss much, it's still annoying to be behind, even by a little bit<br>
