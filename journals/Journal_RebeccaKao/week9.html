			<h2>Week 9</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					That having to walk all the way to the middle school sucks<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					I didn't relate much, there wasn't anything but classwork<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					No, not really.<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					I think it was important for us to finish our protfolios -> Its good experience on how to make your own website<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					I would have been less tired during class, it was kind of hard to focus on everything<br>
