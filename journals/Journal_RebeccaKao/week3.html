			<h2>Week 3</h2>
			<p>
				a. What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?<br>
					No arguments.<br>
				b. What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?<br>
					How to make your websites accessible to people with disabilities. I think it's something important to do and keep track of so I approve of it 100%.<br>
				c. Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.<br>
					Nope. There were not a lot of positions taken and I agreed with all the readings.<br>
				d. What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?<br>
					I think the central concept was how to help people with disabilities navigate your website.<br>
				e. If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?<br>
					I don't think I would have done anything differently, mostly because I don't think i did anything i want to correct.<br>
