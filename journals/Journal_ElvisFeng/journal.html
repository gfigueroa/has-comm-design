		<h2>week 2</h2>
		<p>Week two elvis feng
			This week we learned about the history of HTML, and we start to create our own website. i think the most hard and important thing in this week is how
			to create our own website, because we were using the HTML to do the webpage. The HTML is very important for making the webpage, if you want your
			webpage be more beautiful,you need to use HTML to of all of that to make it pretty. We also learned how to make the webpage to be pretty and tidy this week.

		<h2>week 3</h2>
		<p>Week three elvis feng
			This week we learned how to classify and organize the website, we have to put lots of information in the different group, and these information
			are also should be congruent to the group title. We also learned how to classify which information should be in which group, for example, the school 
			website has lots f information, but we can’t put every information on the website. That is too busy, so we have to classify which information should be 
			together, and put them in a group. If I can do it again, I will help my teammate to discuss the information. The information is pretty good for those.

		<h2>week 4</h2>
		<p>Elvis Feng week 4 communication design
			In this week, we started to do our website, we put our information on the HTML. We also make these information to be their own part,
			it can make the website to be clearly. If I can do this weak again, I will do more stuff and put more information on the website, because I think 
			I didn't do that much information in class.

		<h2>week 5</h2>
		<p>Week 5
			In this week, we were still leaning how to create our own website, and we also learn how to
			create the information of the image. We put the information to the image, and we also have to
			make the outside and inside of the image, and choose the color to create. If I can do this week one
			more time, I will trying to make the image for pretty and rich, and also make the information more
			clearly. Create this HTML image makes me feel very tired, because it is very difficult for me, and
			the HTML’s word is pretty small, make my eyes feel tired, too.

		<h2>week 8</h2>
		<p>Week 8
			In this week, we are learning the new stuff in this week, this things is call CSS. I think the
			CSS is more easier to do than the website, we didn&#39;t start the CSS that far, so I think there is
			nothing I can disagree about CSS, also, if I can do this week again, I will try to more focus on this
			week, and not talking too much on the class.
