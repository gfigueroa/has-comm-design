            This week teacher give us a sample and let us do the as same as the example. The thing that I
            related to the most was to create the same webpage and use all stuff that we learn in the class.
            Same as previous week, there don't have anything that I disagree. The most important things is to
            use waht we learn before and use on this assessment. Lastly, if I could changed anything this week
            I wouldn't talk too much woth my neighbor and take time to finish work inclass.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 12 (11/07-11)</h2>
					<p>
            This week we create a contact.html. We learn how to use margin and other stuff. We also have
            a sematic homework which is also imortant. The thing that I related to the most was to make the booxes.
            There don't have anything that I disagree. The most important
            thing is to use the margin knowledge to create the webpage. Lastly, if I could changed anything this week
            I won't change anything because I think I am good.
