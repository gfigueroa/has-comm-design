					<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:aardvark">Week 1 （08/22-26）</h2>
					<p>
						This week, we talk about bad website, good website, and ake our own rubric.
						I learn how to make our own rubric and use the rubric that we made to grade the website.
						I think the most important thing we learn is how can we know this is a bad website or not.
						If I can do this again I will look on more bad website.
						When we are making a website, we can learn from a bad website.
						Then make my website better. I think there is not disagreement for this week.
						This week that we learn is basic information, so there is no disagreement for me.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 2 (08/29-09/02)</h2>
					<p>
            This week we learned the history of HTML and start to practiced it to create our own website.
						The thing that related the most this week is to create our own website. I don't know how people make the webpage,
						but now I started to learn how to make my webpage. I think this week don't have any disagreement because the things
						that we learn this week is really important for us to make the webpage. I think the most important thing is HTML.
						HTML can make mostly whole webpage and it is really important that we learn it. We also learn how to make the website more beautiful,
						such as, changing the background and text color. The thing that i want do over again this week is that I can be on time in class.
						I won't miss the instruction.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 3 (09/05-09)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learn how to organize our website. For example, organize all the information and put them in different group.
						We also learn how to write the code to organize the webpage. The thing that i related to the most is group different information
						into several categories. Many website don’t have good organization some are good and when people visit it they can clearly find the
						information. I agree with most the reading and what we learn in class. The most important thing that we learn this week is how to build
						many categories in the website. If I could do this week again, i would help out my group in Tuesday and not see them do.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 4 (09/12-16)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learn how to make list, adding links and other stuff. The thing that i related to the most is how to make the list.
						Making some list can let the reader have good understanding and make the webpage clearly. There don’t have any disagreement this week.
						The most important thing that we learn this week is how to build order list and unorderlist in the webpage.
						If I could do this week again, i would like to use some class time to finish codecademy when i finish classwork.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 5 (09/19-23)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learned how to create table and create a summary about what we learned before in HTML.
						The thing that i related to the most was created a table that teacher gave us. To create a table like that is really difficult,
						but i found out that using colspan and rowspan can make the table prettier. This week, there didn’t have any thing that I disagree.
						The most important point or central concept communicated this week was the table. By using many different things, such as "footer",
						"table border", "tr", and "td", to make a pretty table make me feel achievement. Lastly, If i could changed anything this week,
						I would like to put more effort on created the table that teacher let we do in class.
					</p>
          <h2 style="text-align:center">Week 6 (09/26-30)</h2>
					<p>
            This week we started to use what we learn in class to create our website.
            The thing that I related to the most was planning the website. Making a website that is organize can
            get the viewer clear information. Same as previous week, there don't have anything that I disagree.
            There aren't any important things because everything are important. This is the time show what I learn in class.
            If I learn well in pervious class, then i can do my journal website well.
            Lastly, the thing that I would like to change is take time to finish work inclass.
