					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 7 (10/03-07)</h2>
					<p>
            We learned how to add content in the CSS stylesheet for more organized.
            To create a CSS stylesheet is realted the most druing this week. The Washington things
            also important for reviewing the coding skill we have learned.
            Basically, we don’t have any argument or position taken in class and reading for this week.
            The most important for this week is the Washington things. It gave us more reviewing the
            coding skill. If I could changed anything this week,I will teach my neighbor.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 8 (10/11-14)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learn how to create style sheet and learn how to use CSS.
            The thing that I related to the most was learning CSS to make the website better.
            This week, there didn’t have any thing that I disagree. The most important point
            or central concept communicated this week was the Washington things. It gave me more practice
            on CSS. Lastly, if I could changed anything this week,I wouldn't talk too much in class.
          </p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 9 (10/17-21)</h2>
					<p>
						This week, we self-study on the Washington website. We also add the video to our portfolio.
            The thing that I related to the most was to keep learning CSS and self-study.
            There doesn't have any things that I disagree. The most important point was learning
            color stuff on the Washington website. In a webpage, the color is really important because
            people usually don't like the webpage too colorful. If the webpage has color contrast it will
            be good. Lastly, If I could change anything this week,I would like to pay more attention to the
            Washington website.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 10 (10/24-28)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we were doing the unit 3 of University of Washington.
            We were focused on the content and structure. We learn how to add border
            by using "margin & padding." Self-study and doing those exercises from
            the University of Washington website related the most. There didn’t have any
            thing that I disagree with. The most important thing form this week was slef-learning
            and make the webpage look fancy. Lastly, the thing that I would like to change
            is take time to finish work inclass.
