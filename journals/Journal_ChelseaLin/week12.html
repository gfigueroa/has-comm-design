            <h1><b>Week 9 in October</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this week, we learned how to css to make &#60header &#62, &#60 aside&#62 &#60 nav &#62, and &#60 footer &#62 ; this is the most I relate to the class. In addition,I changa my poject homepage by using the &#60 id &#62 and &#60 class&#62 which we learned in this week ; this helps my website page looks better, and I will also change other pages in my project website There are nothing I disagree in this week. If I could do this week again, I will change my learning CSS website become better by using  &#60 id &#62 and &#60 class&#62. However, I didn't do the semantic website well, the &#60 aside &#62 doesn't on same position as the image
