            <h1><b>Week 1 in Augest</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this week, we discussed the difference between good website and bad website: the good website has good quality, clear title and introduction, and understandable information. The bad website has totally opposite features: bad quality, unclear title and introduction, and messy. I believe that learning and understanding the difference between good and bad website will help us to create our own website or our own rubric successfully. All the things that we learn in this week are really basic , and there are nothing I disagree. Undoubtedly, the most important point is learn how to create a good website or a good rubric.
