            <h1><b>Week 2 in September</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
            In this week, we started to learn about HTML: the history of HYML and code of HYMl. We started created our own website by using HYML, and this is I most relate in this week. There is nothing I disagree in this week. I believed the most important point in this week is to learn how to create a website by using HYML. If I could do this week over again, I will adjust my website: color and font size. I believe that can help my website looks better.
