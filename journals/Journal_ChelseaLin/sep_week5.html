            We started work on our portfolio website, and we also make a summary about the HTML. The most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week is the summary about the language of HTML. I related the most in the class in this week is coding and learning the language of HTML. In the beginning of the class, I confused about the language of HTML. After the coding and writing the summary of HTML, I understand the most of language in HTML, but I still confuse about the table. If I could do this week over again, I would try more to understand how to write a table by HTML. There are nothing I disagree in this week.  The most important point in this week is understand all the language that HTML use.
