            <h1><b>Week 11 in November</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
            	In this week, we started create a HASCS website. There are many thing we had not learned before, for example, &#60display&#62, &#60inline&#62,&#60block&#62,and let the visitor be able type on it.
                Last wednesday, we learned &#60display&#62, &#60inline&#62, and &#60block&#62 in class, I knew how to use them to tap the text around the picture, and this is the most I relate to class. However, we have not learn how to let the visitor tap the text on the HASCS website. I hope we can learn this next week.
