            <h1><b>Week 6 in October</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
            In this week, we started use the thing we learned to create our own website, and I also started to learn CSS on Codecademy. I believe that learning the CSS can help me to create a better website. In addition, we started sketch the pages on our own website, and I think it is the thing I relate to the most in class; it help me know direction that my website going to be, and look like.
            <br>we only had two classes in this week because of the typhoon, so I don't have enough time to code on HTML. I think I should code my website during the typhoon day at home.
