            I believe the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week is staring design the homepage of the school. First, we discussed in the group about the lists in the school homepage; we classify different lists to different topic. Designing the school homepage and classifying the lists in school homepage is I relate to the most in the class. There is nothing I disagree in the class.  The most important point is understanding and know what kind of information that we should put on the school homepage. For example, all the lists that we classify in the group should be put on the school homepage. If I could do this week over again more successfully, I will change the classification of lists. I think we didn't classify the lists clearly.
