            <h1><b>Week 9 in October</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this week, we finished unit 3 of CSS and graded the classmates' journal websites. Grading all the websites helps me to know what  my website need to change; this is the most I relate to the class. In addition, I learned how to the link color in this week, so I changed my journal link to the white; people who visit my website will find my journal link easier. There are nothing I disagree in this week.If I could do this week again, I will change my Portfolio because the style in Portfolio is really messy. I created a new file to write the style, and I also wrote style in the top of HTML.
