            <h1><b>Week 4 in September</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
            In this week, we learned more information about HTML; it helps us to write our website on the HTML. In addition, we also created another website in this week. The most persuasive argument and the most point is understanding the language of HTML because it will help us to create the website. I relate the most in class is creating the new website, but because I miss one of classes in this week, I just finished the first step for my new website. I believe the classmates in comm design were already coding something on their new website in the class. If I can do this week over again, I would ask my classmate about the things we learn on the second class that I missed. There is nothing I disagree this week, I believe all things and information we learned is necessary for coding the website.
