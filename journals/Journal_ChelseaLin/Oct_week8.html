            <h1><b>Week 8 in October</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this week, we started to learn CSS. We changed the setting of the style from HTML to CSS; it makes the page be more clearly, and it is easier to code;This is the most persuasive argument introduce . I believe that changing coding style on HTML to CSS is I relate most in the class.; we started learn unite 3 in this week. There is nothing I disagree in this week, but I want to learn how to put a video into my website. I only copy the code to my website. If I could do this week again, I will make the Portfolio website better.
