            <h1><b>Week 7 in October</b></h1>
            <p style="color: black"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this week, all of us work on our own website. I started to find the background image for my website. This is difficult to find a good quality image. In addition, I started using CSS to change the style of my website. Even though we started to learn CSS on Codecademy, I still didn't know how to put CSS into HTML. After I asked Peggy, I knew how to do this. I think this is the thing that I relate to the most in the class. There are nothing I disagree in this week. If I could do this week again, I will make my website be better, because we learn more thing about CSS and HTML. I think I can add these new thing into my website.
