				<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 7 (10/3-7)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learned how to add content in the CSS stylesheet. We create
						the CSS stylesheet the most in this week. Also, the Washington things are the really
						important part for this stylesheet, we can learned a lot on it. Actually there is no
						argument for this week. The most important part is the Washington things, because
						it really help a lot for our CSS stylesheet. If I could change anything this week, I will
						try to stay focus on the work more.
					</p>
				<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 8 (10/11-14)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learned how to create the stylesheet and how to use the CSS.
						I think the most related things in this week was learning how to use CSS, and make
						the website better. There is no argument for this week. I think the most important
						thing for this week was also the Washington things, it also help a lot when we are
						making the website. If l could change anything this week, I will try to learn more
						detail from the Washington things.

					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 9 (10/17-21)</h2>

					This will be soon.

					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 10 (10/24-28)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we were doing the unit 3 of University of Washington.
            We were focused on the content and structure. We learn how to add border
            by using "margin and padding." Self-study and doing the exercises from
            the University of Washington website related the most. There didnâ€™t have any
            thing that I disagree with. The most important thing form this week was slef-learning
            and make the webpage look better. The thing that I would like to change
            is to finish my work in class and also my homework.
