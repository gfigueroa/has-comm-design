					<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:aardvark">Week 1 （08/22-26）</h2>
					<p>
						This week, we learn about the bad website and good website, 
						and also create our own rubric. I think the most important thing is to know how to do the resolution with good website and bad website, 
						if we know it, and we can know is our website good or bad, 
						and make it better. If I can do this again, I will try to look more bad website and good website, 
						and know the personality of them, and I can make my website better afterward. 
						We only learn the few things this week, we only learn something very basic, 
						so I think there is nothing I can disagree.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 2 (08/29-09/02)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learned about how to use HTML to make our own website, and also learn a little bit of the history of HTML and CSS. 
						The thing we mostly learn in this week is to make our own webpage, first we have to learn about the HTML, 
						we have to make the tag, title, head...etc, and also learn how to change our own website background. 
						This week we only learn how to create and read some history about HTML, so I have nothing to disagree. 
						If I could do this we again, I will try to more understand about the HTML, like title, tags or link.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 3 (09/05-09)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learn how to make the website neat. For example, organize all the information and put them in different section.
						The thing that i related to the most is put different information into several categories. Many website don’t have good organization.
						When people see the webpage, they can clearly find the information. I agree with most the reading and what we learn in class. 
						The most important thing that we learn this week is how to build many categories in the website and made it neat. 
						If I could do this week again, I will focus and help my classmate.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 4 (09/12-16)</h2>
					<p>
						 This week we learn about make list and adding links. The thing that i related to the most is how to make the list. 
						 That list can let the reader clearly understand what is the website about and know we are going to do.
						 There is no any disagreement  this week. The most important thing that we learn this week is how to build the list and list it in the webpage. 
						 If I could do this week again, i would like to use the extra time in class to do more work.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 5 (09/19-23)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we learned how to create table and create a summary about what we learned before in HTML. 
						In this class I just know that using colspan and rowspan can make the table prettier. This week, there 
						is nothing that I disagree. The most important point or central concept communicated this week was the table. 
						By using many different things, such as "footer", "table border", "tr", and "td", to make a pretty table make me feel achievement. 
						Lastly, If i could changed anything this week, I would like to put more effort on created the table that teacher let we do in class.
					</p>
					<h2 style="text-align:center">Week 6 (09/26-30)</h2>
					<p>
						This week we started to use what we learn in class to create our website.
						The thing that I related to the most was planning the website. Making a website that is organize can
						get the viewer clear information. Same as previous week, there don't have anything that I disagree.
						There aren't any imfortant things because everything are important. This is the time show what I learn in class.
						If I learn well in pervious class, then i can do my journal website well. Lastly, I would like to change is take time to finish work inclass.
