					In this week. We learn about how to make
					our own web. And how to do like design 
					your own web page. You can add anything 
					you want in your page. We also learned how 
					to clean up our website like assort our 
					website. We try to make a school website 
					and the assort part is really important. 
					We did like group work. We worked together
					and I learn so many things form Peggy and
					Chelsea . They help me a lot. So in this 
					week we are not only learned about how to 
					create a website but also learn about the 
					group work. In the group we all do 
					something for our own part for our job. 
					In the end of this week we also make our 
					own ideal website by drawing. It is really
					useful and we can have a idea for our future 
					website looks like.</td></font>
