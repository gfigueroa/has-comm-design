				        Time is really fast! This week is already our 9th week of this semester!
                        This week we have lots of problem haha. Because of the AC we have change 
                        the class room to middle school.
                    </br>
                        In this case, we moved all of our folder to middle school computer lab. 
                        We are working on our Protfolio this week. We did the half of this unit 3,
                        That really a lot. We still work on our Unit3. I wish I can finish it on 
                        time.
                    </br>
                        That is what I did for this week. And I have more knowlage about CSS right
                         now that is so good.
