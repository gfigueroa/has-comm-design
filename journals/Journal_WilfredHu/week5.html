					This week we learn lots of things. We 
					even finish the summary of HTML, that 
					helps us to understand what we done for
					HTML more. In the summary I also learn
					lots of things and review a lot. Do this
					summary helps me a lot. I remember how
					to do like make my website's (style) 
					like I review how to change the color,
					how to change the background color and 
					the size of the my links. I also know how
					to make my link to be special like 
					(em)(/em)(strong)(/strong) these things 
					I forgot really often. But now I already 
					can use it really clear and easy to make 
					my website more interested.
						</br>
					The best part of this week is I learn about
					how to make a (table)(/table). In table 
					everything will be clearer that we can see.
					Like you can list a menu or something like 
					that. It will be really clear and that you 
					can know things directly. But the defect of
					this table is, it is really complicated. That
					you have to write lots of things to complete
					this link. But if we understand this case it
					will be really helpful.
						</br>
					I think the really hardest part of this week 
					is to make a table. So I think I will use more
					time to understand what does (table)(/table) 
					doing, because it is helpful to me. Table is
					also the important part of HTML. In HTML we
					use (table)really often because it is a clear
					way to show data and some important information.</td></font>
