					This week, we have two typhoon days so we
					have one class cancel. But although we 
					just have two days for this week I still 
					learned a lot of things this week.
						</br>
					Like we started our first project this week.
					I know that I am not good at built up a best
					website ever. But I will try hard to at least
					let my project one to be clear and beautiful. 
					I can use the code to built up my owe website
					it is really excited and cool. Maybe I can't 
					really let it be perfect but I will try hard.
						</br>
					Thank you Mr. Figueroa. Thank you for let 
					us to finish the module 2, that helps me a lot.
					During I did the activities of module 2 I 
					review lots of things that I am close to forget!
					So this is a really great things I wanted to say.
					Our project 1 will due next Friday, I wish I can
					done it at time. And done it clear as well.</td></font>
