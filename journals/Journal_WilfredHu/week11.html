				    In week11 we have made a website. Mr. Figueroa gave us a sample and let us to 
					rebuild a website as the sample he gave us. The website is about the computer 
					lab in Hsinchu American School. The website of our computer lab. In the website 
					it has lots of things to do. It is a professional website that we need to make 
					one.
					</br>
					This was really hard to do because it has lots of works and Mr. Figueroa said that 
					we can not use table to do this website that lets this project be more difficult.
					</br>
					We haven't finish it yet. I hope we could make it next week to use what we have learnt.
