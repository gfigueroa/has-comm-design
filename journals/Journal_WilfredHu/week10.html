				      In this week this is our 10th week for comm design class!
					  This week we have done our profortlio! That is about Web Deswign
					  & Development unit 3. It was very very hard to do. But we still 
					  finish it.
					  </br>
					  In that unit we have done lots of works! It has about color about 
					  websites compare and lots of things. It was really hard to work on.
					  But we still use our best to do that. Durion the Unit 3 it used 
					  really a lot of time and use a lot of forces. But I think throw this 
					  weel I have learnt a lot.
