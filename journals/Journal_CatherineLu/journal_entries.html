        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        I don’t think there was any persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week because most of the topics discussed were how to differentiate between a good and a bad website.
        We learned different aspects to consider when judging a website, such as the links, graphics, navigation, organisation and etc. The topics introduced this week were mostly opinionated, so none of them were persuasive or convincing.
        <br/></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I could relate to all the activities in class, because as a teenager living in the 21st century surfing the web is part of my everyday routine. When surfing the web, I judge the website a lot.
        Thus, this week’s activities were what I could relate to the most.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.</em><br>
        I don’t disagree with any arguments or positions taken in this week’s class.
        Aforementioned, this week we learned how to characterise good and bad websites.
        We learned how to judge a website from multiple different aspects and I completely agree with all of them.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
        I think the most important point or central concept learned this week was how to tell apart a well designed website from a horribly designed one. In class, we did a lot of group activities relating to judging websites. We also came up with a rubric to judge websites.
        The common theme to these exercises was to learn the components that make up a well designed website.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?</em><br>
        If I could redo this week, I would like to change one of my answers in the survey.
        In the survey, under the question relating to group work, I wrote that I was strongly against group work.
        After several different group activities and exercises, I’ve changed my views about group work.
        I learned that by doing group work it allows each member to exchange ideas.
        It gives everyone the opportunity to learn from your classmates and grow together.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Helvetica; text-align:center; font-size:35px"><strong>Week 2</strong></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        Excluding the class I was absent, there weren’t any arguments presented this week. This week we learned about multiple different things including the HTML language itself, colors displayed, importance of web standards, emphasis. Out of all the things we’ve learned, there were mostly knowledge about web design instead of arguments.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I could relate to the activities we did in Friday’s class the most, because we actually started learning the basics of HTML. We started to actually code and learn the language instead of understanding the principles. It gave me this sudden flashback to last year when I took AP computer science with Mr. Kerr and Annshine.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.</em><br>
        Mentioned above, since most of the things we’ve covered this week were lectures and discussion questions about HTML, there weren’t any arguments or positions presented. Thus, I do not disagree with any of them.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
        I think the most important or central concept communicated this week was the importance of web standards and the basics of HTML. We spent an entire class going through the basic structures and tags of HTML and another on answering discussion questions. Through all the exercises, we are now capable of creating basic tags! That’s why I think the most important concept this week was the basics of HTML.<br></p>
        <p><em style="color:#787878">If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?</em><br>
        I would not do this week over again, because —in my opinion—this week was perfect. We finally started writing code and learning about the basics of HTML after 2 weeks of discussion questions. HTML puts me in utter awe and confusion, but so far I am loving it.</p>

        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        Again, there weren’t really any arguments presented this week. This week we learned how to organize a website and some more basics of HTML. In class, we did group works which we all unanimously agreed. In all, there weren’t any arguments presented this week.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I couldn’t really relate to the activity (categorizing and organizing pages) in class, because I’ve never created any webpages that had more than 2 pages. The coding, however, was relatable since I’ve been coding since the moment I stepped into HAS.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.</em><br>
        I don’t disagree with any of the arguments or positions presented this week in class. During the class activity, we unanimously agreed to how to organize the tabs and pages. Additionally, I do not disagree with any of the things we learned during the lectures.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
        I think the most important or central concept communicated this week was how to properly organize all the webpages and subpages. We spent an entire class completing a group activity that was mainly about organizing all the pages of a school website.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?</em><br>
        If I could do this week over again, I would spend more time to reduce the number of categories for our group activity. Our group had a total of 9 categories. Other than that, I enjoyed this week’s class and wouldn’t redo anything else.</p>

        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        Again, there weren’t any arguments presented this week. This week we focused mainly on learning the syntax of HTML. We did a lot of self learning with the website by University of Washington. I don’t recall any arguments being introduced, so there wasn’t a persuasive argument.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        What I could relate to the most in class was the coding, because—as mentioned—in previous journal entries. I’ve been coding since the moment I stepped into HAS. Learning the syntax of HTML brings back memories from middle school.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.</em><br>
        Aforementioned, there weren’t any arguments in class. We centred this week’s lessons on the syntax and basic structure of an HTML website. Thus, there weren’t any arguments or positions that I strongly disagreed.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
        I think this week’s most important or central concept was the syntax and basic structure of an HTML website. This week in class we started writing the code for our Web Portfolio by following the instructions of the website created by University of Washington.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?</em><br>
        I wouldn’t do this week over again. Following the website by University of Washington, I managed to create the basic structure of my web portfolio. Seeing my code turning into an actual webpage was the coolest thing ever. I enjoy this week’s class because it was mainly coding!</p>

        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        Again, there weren’t really any arguments presented this week. I would suggest you to change this question, because I keep on writing the same answer over and over again. This week we learned more of the HTML syntax. We learned the backbone behind a webpage and also self-studied using Codecademy.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I could relate to the coding and using Codecademy the most, because—as mentioned last week—I’ve been coding since the moment I stepped into HAS and last year I started self learning languages from Codecademy.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.</em><br>
        I don’t disagree with any of the arguments or positions presented this week in class since we mostly self learned on Codecademy and followed Mr. Figueroa’s lecture on HTML.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
        I think the most important or central concept communicated this week was how to properly use the HTML basics that we learned last week. We spent most of our classes completing activities such as making a table using HTML from scratch.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?</em><br>
        I wouldn’t do the week over again, because this week was the first week that we focused solely on coding and I really enjoy coding.</p>

        <p><em style="color:#787878">What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?</em><br>
        Nothing persuasive was introduced this week since the topics covered were coding-based. This week’s topics were centered around html coding and completing the project, no arguments were presented this week.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I could relate to the coding the most, because I’ve been coding since the beginning of time. Coding has become apart of my life, so coding in this class reminded me of AP computer science last year.

        I think the most important point or central concept communicated this week was just familiarizing with the basic structure of html and how to utilize the syntax to create a website.

        There weren’t any persuasive or convincing arguments introduced this week since were mainly learning the syntax of CSS and connecting it to HTML. Thus, no arguments were presented and I don’t think any were particularly persuasive.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
        I could relate to the coding the most because I’ve coded since the beginning of time (yes, the beginning of time). Thus, the exercises we do relates me to the coding I’ve been doing in the past years.

          Since we mainly worked on remaking Mr. Figueroa’s HS Computer Science website, there weren’t any arguments presented in this week’s classes. Due to the non-existence of arguments, I didn’t find any arguments persuasive.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>

          During this week’s class, Mr. Figueroa taught us positioning as well as floating in HTML. Additionally, we practiced using stylesheets with a basic HTML document to style it. Thus, there weren’t any arguments or introduced this week. Therefore, I don’t find any arguments persuasive or convincing.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?</em><br>
          Since we started diving into coding, I’ve been able to relate to the coding the most because I’ve always enjoyed coding and it reminds me of precious memories from AP Computer Science class.

          As mentioned in the first question above, this week classes were focused on learning positioning, floating and practicing styling using CSS stylesheet. Thus, no arguments were presented and so I neither agree nor disagree with any of them.
        <p><em style="color:#787878">What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?</em><br>
          I think the central concept communicated this week is how to use position and float to layout a web page because we did several activities using these properties in class. I think another important point is to familiarize ourselves with styling a web page using CSS.

          I definitely wouldn’t do this week over again, because I enjoyed this week’s classes 100%. This week class time was longer since we didn’t need to walk all the way to middle school. Also, I enjoyed this week’s classes because I learned new properties of CSS and used class time effectively.
