		Now, we are back to washington University thing, continue my portfolio.<br/>
		And, finally, I add my video to portfolio, but I dont have subtitle :(, my favorite part of portfolio is that people can go to my Youtube Channel!!<br/>
		I get more views, even money! $$ I feel very happy to keep updating my Journal Project, and I can show my website to my friend.<br/>
		Also, in this week, Mr. Figueroa teached us about CSS tab, which I learned in Codecademy already, we can add style in CSS/Stylesheets instead of HTML tab.<br/>
		Which is very useful!</p>
