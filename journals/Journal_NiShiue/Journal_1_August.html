		<p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 25px">Things I learn in this week is how to decide the good websites and bad websites.<br/>
		Good websites have clear purpose, organized and neat information, and awesome color choice<br/>
		Bad websites have night-mare color choice, confusing purpose and information.<br/>

		I think the most important I learn in this week is draw a rubric with my group: Niles, me, Cindy, Anson, and Elvis.<br/>

		The most happy thing in this week is that we talk about how to design our rubric for websites. I feel I participate to this event, and I think we make a really good rubric. That rubric will make Mr. Figueroa like :)<br/>

		Mr. Figueroa will love our color, traits, descriptor choice!</p>
