		<p style = "text-align:center; font-size: 25px">This week, I learned about CSS in html. We use position, display, and float to change the position of something in HTML<br/>
		I learned that, if you roll the center of the house, then a thing stays, it has position: fixed.<br/>
		Float left or right, would make a thing go to left and rich, I mean right, obviously. I can use display: inline to make 2 or more things to be in a line.<br/>
		At thursday, Mr. Figueroa told us to make another semantic image by using these new techniques we learned this week. I finished, but, it's so ugly :(.</p>
