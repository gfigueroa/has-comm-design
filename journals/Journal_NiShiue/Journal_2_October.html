		The only things that I havn't finished is put in the journal for every month.<br/>
		Since, It's only October 8th today, so I will keep updating every week for latest Journal.<br/>
		I find out the project is very good, because in the future, Mr. Figueroa will make this project<br/>
		become a real website, and on my Homepage, I add my youtube channel, NiTringo NBA!<br/>
		Maybe I can get more views from the project, even Money!! $$$!<br/>
		Also, I finished Unit 5 of Codecademy like yesterday, I learn some CSS skills, and I<br/>
		learn about CSS, you need to do it on the other tab, not the original HTML tab.<br/>
		It has its own tab for CSS.</p>
