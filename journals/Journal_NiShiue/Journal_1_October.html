		The project is about making a brilliant website for our journal entries from each week, like this one.<br/>
		I almost finished my homepage of the webpage, I split them to each month, like august has 1 journal, September has like 4 journals. <br/>
		I am still thinking about the font of the title, Mr. Figueroa says comic sans is the worst, even Niles says that LOL. But I think comic sans is awesome. I will keep working my web next class, of course.</p>
