					August 22, 2016 was a really exciting day, especially for the students, because it was
					the first day of school. The night before the school start, I was very exciting and my
					mood was exhilarate that my body was full of energy, just like the battery was fully
					charged, because this summer vacation is just boring, and I can’t wait to meet my 
					friends and new students in school. At the morning, I wake up with no distraction and
					interference, just like the feeling when I wake up during the summer vacation, no
					pressure, no bother. When I looked at my phone I just realized that I’m definitely
					going to be late for school, I packed up my stuff and start heading to school. When I
					have arrived the school, the ceremony was almost done that I missed the important
					information about the school. After the ceremony was done, people start moving to
					their home room. There were lots of new students that has transfer to our school,
					which create a different feeling to me that I feels like the school was new and fresh
					to me. All in all, the school has changed a lot, especially the environment has
					changed a lot, student no longer speaks English in school anymore, and students can
					no longer use the facilities from the old place.
