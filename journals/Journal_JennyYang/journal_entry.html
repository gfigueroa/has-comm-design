			<h2><img src="img/journal-image.png" height="30" width="30"/>Week 1</h2>

			<p>
				This week I learned about good and bad website by comparing the world's worst website and the world fact book.
				We discussed in details and answered the question. Also, we created our rubric by groups.
				I don’t think there is an argument I strongly agree or not because we didn’t learn that much in this week.
				I think the most important point in this week is to browse different kinds of websites and think about what makes
				it bad/ good, because I had never done this before. If I could do this week over again,
				I would like to find more websites and go through more details in it.
			</p>

			<h2><img src="img/journal-image.png" height="30" width="30"/>Week 2</h2>
			<p>
				This week we learned about the history of HTML and css, also we learned about using HTML to create our website.
				I think making our first webpage is the thing that related the most this week, since we have to design our own
				webpages later on, learning HTML is the first step. Basically, we have covered this week is reading and discussion,
				so just like last week I don’t think there is any argument I disagree. I think the most important point this week is
				to learn coding, we stared to learn about HTML such as how to make links, tags, titles…etc. And we also tried to
				change the background color by ourselves. If I could do this we again more successfully, I would finish reading
				all of the history about HTML in detail, because since we don’t have much time in the class, I just read over it.
			</p>

			<h2><img src="img/journal-image.png" height="30" width="30"/>Week 3</h2>
			<p>
				I think the most persuasive argument in this week is to learn how to classify categories, but since I absent for
				one class, I don’t really know much about it. I think to organize categorizes related the most in class this week,
				because I think the most important thing for a good website is easy to find things, which is well organize. I don’t
				have any argument for this week. If I can do this week again, I want to be in the class to work with my group,
				because I like to work in group and communicate my thought with others.
			</p>

			<h2><img src="img/journal-image.png" height="30" width="30"/>Week 4</h2>
			<p>
				This week we learned more about create our own portfolio and add features in order to make it more fancy and organize.
				The thing I related to the most this week is to build the navigation menu. Before I learned HTML, I have no idea about
				create website. I don’t know I can create an ordered and unordered list and even we can do anything we want by coding,
				such as change the font. There wasn’t an argument I strongly disagree this week, but I think self learning coding
				sometime is little difficult to me. However, my classmates will help me so that wasn’t a big deal. I think the most
				important point this week is to learn those common tags in HTML. This week we learned more tags in HTML in order to
				make our portfolio more organize, just like I mention above. If I could change this week again, I wouldn’t change
				anything because since I followed all the instructions I think this week was really successful.
			</p>

			<h2><img src="img/journal-image.png" height="30" width="30"/>Week 5</h2>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q1-->
						What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px">
						The most persuasive argument this week is to learn about how to create tables through HTML by using tags such
						as &lt;tr&gt and &lt;td&gt tags.
					</p>

					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q2-->
						What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px">
						Since I got a fever and absent for a class, I think Codecademy relate to the most in class because I can use
						Codecademy to self-study in order to make up the thing I miss in class.
					</p>

					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q3-->
						Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed?
						Explain your reaction.
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px">
						No, there isn’t any argument in the class just like previous weeks because basically, we are learning HTML
						coding.
					</p>

					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q4-->
						What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px">
						I think the most important point in this week was learned more about HTML syntax.
						Using &lt;tr&gt, &lt;td&gt…etc. tags are something new we had learned this week.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q5-->
						 If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px">
						I will like to do this week over again because I miss a class. But since I couldn’t do this week again,
						in reality, I will use my free time to make up the thing I missed in class.
