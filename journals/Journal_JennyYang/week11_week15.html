				<ol>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q1-->
						What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A1-->
						This week we have imitated a school website Mr. Figueroa made, by using the previous knowledge we have learn.
					</p>

					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q2-->
						What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A2-->
						To imitate a school website related the most because by doing this, we can notice that do we understand the concept we just learned, such as I discovered that I don't know how to use section and footer, but I knew how to use for now.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q3-->
						Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A3-->
						I don't think there is any argument for this week; I think everything works well.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q4-->
						What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A4-->
						Imitate a school website by ourself was the most important point because, in order to finish the website,  we have to clarify all the concept we have learned before, such as padding, marginâ€¦etc.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q5-->
						 If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A5-->
						This week I had clarified a lot of concepts while I was imitated the website, so I think I would not do this week over again.
					</p>
				</ol>

				<ol>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q1-->
						What was the most persuasive or convincing argument introduced this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A1-->
						This week we are learning how to create a website content by using a css stylesheet.
					</p>

					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q2-->
						What could you relate to the most in class or in the readings this week? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A2-->
						Using CSS stylesheet to create website content related the most because we used HTML to create content before, but now we start using CSS. Which can make a website more organize also we can control content more accurately.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q3-->
						Was there an argument or position taken in class or in the readings with which you strongly disagreed? Explain your reaction.
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A3-->
						No, there isn't any argument just like previous weeks.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q4-->
						What do you think was the most important point or central concept communicated this week?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A4-->
						Using CSS to create website content related the most because by using CSS we can create a better/ more organize website.
					</p>
					<li style="margin-bottom:0px"><!--Q5-->
						 If you could do this week over again more successfully, what would you do differently? Why?
					</li>
					<p style="margin-top:0px"><!--A5-->
