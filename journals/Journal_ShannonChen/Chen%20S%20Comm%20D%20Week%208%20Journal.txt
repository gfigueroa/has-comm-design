Chen, Shannon - Week 7
	This week, we finally got into css style sheet, which means that we don’t need to deal with the messy style attribute. Using css sheet or tab, <style>, helps us keep our code more organize and more easy to utilize it. Additionally, by using style sheet, we can improve the design of our website and make the quality better. I can’t wait to learn more about css sheet and java script which are really helpful when we are designing out webpage. If I could change anything this week I wouldn’t change anything, since it was I great week and I had a lot of fun and surprises when we were learning CSS style sheet.
