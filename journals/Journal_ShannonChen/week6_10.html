            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we were still working on our project. However, in codecademy, we already started some topics about css sheet which was a easier way to manage the style of the website. When I was working on my project, the major issue was I could not create a fancy website because most of the code required css style sheet or java script. If I could do this week again, I would want to start my codecademy earlier which would help my project look better.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we were still working on our project during the class time. However, in code academy, we started to learn some basic concept about css style sheets. By using css style sheets, it is easier to modify all of the styles and colors. You can see the styles in a more organized format. If I could change anything this week, I would want to change the pace for my schedule which allowed me to focus more on my style of the website.
            <h3 style = "color: #3a2613; font-family:Fantasy">Week8</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we finally got into css style sheet, which means that we don’t need to deal with the messy style attribute. Using css sheet or tab, &lt;style&gt;, helps us keep our code more organize and more easy to utilize it. Additionally, by using style sheet, we can improve the design of our website and make the quality better. I can’t wait to learn more about css sheet and java script which are really helpful when we are designing out webpage. If I could change anything this week I wouldn’t change anything, since it was I great week and I had a lot of fun and surprises when we were learning CSS style sheet.
            <h3 style = "color: #3a2613; font-family:Fantasy">Week9</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we were mainly working on the Web D2. The topics were about css styles sheet and some basic ideas about what a good website looks like. By searching different websites, we could see that space, font, hierarchy, contrast are all important elements that could affect a website. Besides working on Web D2, we also viewed everyone’s project. By viewing other project, I saw some of the interesting ideas and layouts which inspired me to come up with some more new ideas about my project. Additionally, I think that our rubric actually contains a lot of important element such as dead page. If I could change anything this week, I would want to look more detail into other’s web page.

            <h3 style = "color: #3a2613; font-family:Fantasy">Week10</h3>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we were mainly self-studying the materials from the University of Washington. I did not really like to self-study especially when the things get harder. A lot of concepts were really confused and hard to understand such as positions in css. In contrast, I like codecademy better since it will immediately show result of the code that you apply on the screen, also it will point out the part that you did wrong. If I could change anything of this week, i would want to have more time and read closely about the Web D2 materials.
