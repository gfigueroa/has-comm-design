            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we were trying to replicate a website that the teacher provided us. This was way harder than to create our own website, because I would usually give up when I couldn't make my website to what I think. Moreover, I thought the challenge was more interesting than creating our own website, since it was like solving a math questions. We need to keep trying, until we reach the goal of having the same appearance of the website. Despite copying a website, we also learned the concept of position and display. By fully understand the concept, we could replicate the website much more easier without using tables. If I could redo this week again, I wouldnâ€™t want to change anything since I already tried my best to copy the website.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we were mainly learning about positions, including display, relative, static, absolute and fixed. However, when I was copying the code, I felt like I learned everything and could easily modify these concepts by myself. When I am replicate the chart for homework, I started to face a lot or problems. Since we could not make the chart with the table, I first wanted to use float left and float right. There came more problems that needed to be fixed. I found out that it was not that easy I thought. If I could do this week again, I would want to pay more attention in class that I could able to finish my homework.
