            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we learned about good website and bad website. By viewing different kinds of website, we understood how a good website should look like. Additionally, we created our own rubric by our perspectives. Before this class, I did not realize that using different browsers would change how the website looked like. I think that knowing this new concept is important, since when we have a chance to create our own website, we should put more attention on it and try to make the least differences. If I could do this week again, I wish I could have more time and have a chance to do some online research on making the rubric, it would make the rubric more detailed.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning of this week, we combined all of the ideas and created our own rubric. Also, we learned about different versions of HTML and the history of HTML which has improved a lot since it was invented. In the reading of HTML, we understood that the consistency, contrast and white Space are the three important elements that you need to consider when you are making a website. The reading of color blind that me think of my friend who is color blind that can not distinguish red and green. It makes me think that we should be more aware of someone who is disable and make the website more user friendly. If I could do this week again I would not want to miss the first HTML coding class, since sometimes it is hard to catch up the missing code.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of this week, we learned about the method and the structure to group a website. Additionally, we worked in groups to figure out our own structure of school website. Organizing different categories was not as easy as we thought about, since there were lots of way to organize a web site. We tried out best to organize a website that the user could easily find the information that they need. Despite organizing the website structure, we also worked on HTML which was my first week of coding HTML. Although the HTML website wasn’t fancy at all, it reminded me the high school computer science class that I took last year. Seeing something printed on the browser made me feel exciting, just like the first time when I saw my c++ code working and was printed on the console. If I could do this week again, I won’t change anything. Since our group organized the website really well, and even created a clear structure of our website which followed our own logic.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, we were mainly coding during the class. We followed the instruction from the University of Washington and created a website that was structured by the University. Although we did not have a chance to structure our website, the practice still gave us a glance of how a good website looked like which related to the previous lesson we learned. I really liked the coding part of this class, since it was similar to the computer science class which I was always excited when I reload the web page. The central concepts of this week were being familiar with the syntax of HTML and applied what we learned from codecademy. I was really excited about the moment when we actually finished our website. Hope it looked pretty nice and structured well. If I could start this week again, I would review the things that I learned from code academy that I could be more familiar with the syntax that I learned.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week we were mainly working on our first project which was to create a website about out journal entries. The project was separated into two different parts, one was Website plan and the other was html coding. This week I was working on the structure of the website and files. Working on this project reminded the HSCS flash project that we did last year. They were similar because we need to build our own project from zero and they both required a lot of design. The central concept of this week was to applied what we learned from pervious weeks and worked a project on our own. If I could do this week over again, I would want to focus more on other html website examples which might inspire me more about web design.
