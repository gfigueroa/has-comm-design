    <h3>The Crucible</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; The Crucible, written by Miller in 1953, is a story that has a hard affected by American's
      political situation during Red Scare. Miller wrote the story as an allegory, which he wanted to use Salem
      Witch trails to represent the McCarthy blacklist and accused those communists. In the story, due to people's
      personal disagreements, the people of Salem likely cited others as a witch. Which it present in the reality,
      the McCarthy in order to stop people spreading out the communism, they blame writers and entertainers as a
      communist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; First, at the beginning of the story, when Parris was arguing the cause of Betty's coma with
      Abigail, in order to protect Betty who is his daughter, he started accused Tituba as a witch, "I saw Tituba
      waving her arms over fire when I come on you" (Miller 144). Paris began accused Abigail in a particular example
      which he notices Tituba, and a group of girls is dancing in the forest. Even more, Paris thought that is the
      reason cause Betty bewitched because he not only saw Tituba dancing but also heard a "screeching" and "gibberish"
      coming from Tituba's mouth (Miller 144). Later on, Abigail to save herself, she tried to accuse Goody Proctor as
      a witch by saying Goody Proctor wasn't "blush about her name." Also, due to their personal disagreements, Abigail
      said that "She hates me uncle, she must, for I would not be her slave" (Miller 144). This quote is an obvious
      example shows most of the characters accuse other as a witch because they want to save themselves out of the
      problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;Second, Miller wrote a long description of Thomas Putnam that he said, "he was a man with many
      grievances" (145). Putnam is the character who loses seven babies, "his vindictive nature demonstrated long
      before the witchcraft began" (Miller 145). The quote seems like the reason Thomas Putnam accuses others as
      a witch because he wants to take revenge for his wife. Moreover, when Putnam tried to imply that Betty as a
      witch, “There is a murdering witch among us, bound herself in the dark. (Parris turns to Betty, a frantic
      terror rising in him)” (Miller 146). To protect his daughter, Parris quickly accuse Abigail by evidence,
      "(to Abigail). Then you were conjuring spirits last night” (Miller 146). However Abigail did not admit,
      she whispered and said, "Not I, sir – Tituba and Ruth" (Miller 146).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;Last but not least, as Mary Warren was worried that she would accuse someone because all
      the country was charged others as a witch, "The village is out! I just come from the farm; the whole
      country's talkin' witchcraft! They'll be callin' us witches, Abby!" (Miller 147). However Mercy is already
      found out the solution to protect them, which is to accuse others before been charged, "She mans to tell,
      I know it" (Miller 147). Throughout the conversation, it shows us Mary and Mercy are ready to accuse others
      due to personal disagreements, which is afraid been access by others. Finally, when Betty woke up, she
      accused Abigail "drank blood" which is acting like a witch, "You drank blood, Abby! You didn't tell him
      that!" (Miller 148). Undoubtedly, Abigail responds angrily and tell Betty to shut up. However, Betty in order
      to protect her innocence, she dissolved into sobs and said, "You did, you did! You drank a charm to kill
      John Proctor's wife! You drank a charm to kill Goody Proctor!" (Miller 148). The action shows that Betty
      charged Abigail to let herself out of the problems that are being a witch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; To sum up, in the play, people often accused others as a witch because they had personal
      disputes just like the time through Red Scare. In reality, people afraid of being accused of communism
      so they charge people arbitrary in order to protect themselves. Therefore, Miller wrote the play by gave
      lots of evidence to imply the situation through the period.
