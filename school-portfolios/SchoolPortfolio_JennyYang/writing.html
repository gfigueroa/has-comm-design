    <h3>Information Age</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Scientists have different claims about the beginning of information age, because they seem to
      define what a computer is in different ways. Some consider early arithmetic and logical devices as the birth
      of computers, while others are stricter. According to Daniel Stephen, the first mechanical computer was
      invented by Charles Babbage in 1822. The first personal computer was created in 1977 (Stephen). It seems
      ambiguous how people define computers. Regardless of the definition issues, another question is whether the
      invention of computers stands for the beginning of the information age. Will the invention of Internet be more
      likely to represent the actual time of information age? According to M. Campbell, the first Internet was invented
      in late 1960s (Campbell). These invention times are much earlier than the information age we think. There is
      actually a gap between the first invention of information technologies and the way technologies change people's
      lives. Taking all of this into consideration, it seems that the information age began in 21st century based on
      three reasons: (1) globalization of digital media, (2) development of social networking and smart phone technology
      and (3) influences of these technologies on political changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; First of all, the information age began in 2000s because the digital revolution became truly global
      at that time. Before 1990s, most computer users could only share limited information in some restricted places at
      a specific time. They had to use disks to exchange information with limited loads, or transferred messages/signals
      from one to another by pigeon post, oceanic telegraph cables or though the Morse system. It was inconvenient for
      them to exchange information. During the 12 years from 1990 to 2002, the number of people using the Internet
      multiplied in number by 224 times. By 2002 there were 631 million Internet users worldwide, which marked the
      largest increase during the span. "After revolutionizing society in the developed world in the 1990s, the digital
      revolution spread to the masses in the developing world in the 2000s" (International Telecommunication Union and
      United Nations Population Division). In other words, in the 21st century most computer users are no longer limited
      to specific places and times in order to share information. When the information technology is globalized, it
      means that people around the world mostly can enjoy the efficiency and development it brought forth. The
      information age literally belongs to the whole human beings rather than a privileged group of people. As the
      computer technology was just invented in 1970s, only a few people could access and benefit from the development
      by that time. It doesn't seem to be a right moment to be called information age. As a result, the information age
      began in 2000s because most of the world citizens can truly share information unrestrictedly and enjoy the
      advancement altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Second, the information age began in 2000s because the development of social networking and
      smart phone technology brought up a cultural shock referring to habits and customs different from before.
      For example, people text or use e-books while driving or attending classes. During 2000s, information
      scientists and companies invented new software and hardware including smartphones (iPhone, Samsung, HTC… etc.),
      social network sites (Facebook, twitter, instagram… etc.) and so on. The first iPhone was introduced to the
      modern world by Steve Jobs in 2007 (Mathew). It initiated a new era to change the way people live because
      more and more people use texts and emails instead of making a phone call and writing mails. IPhones'
      successful commercial campaigns attracted all people's attention and brought up a worldwide trend to use
      smartphones. IPhone almost became a synonym of smartphones, and spurred more and more people to approach
      mobile information technology. Moreover, the most famous social networking site Facebook was designed by
      Mark Elliot Zuckerberg in 2004. Originally the Facebook page was designed for Harvard students, and later
      it opened up to other college students in the United States. According to an official estimate, Facebook
      has had more than 1.5 billion active users as of 2015 (newsroom). The social networking page allows people
      to share messages, photos, videos and to record special events in their life. Before the invention of
      smartphones and social networking sites, people kept a dairy to record their special events or took a note
      to remind themselves of daily things. With these information technologies, people changed their old routines
      and took advantages of these more convenient ways to live their life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, the information age began in 2000s because those information technologies not only
      changed the way people lived but also the way people thought. Using smartphones and social networking site,
      people are able to share public and private information more efficiently. When they get the information,
      they begin to think of things from different perspectives. Taking three social and political protests during
      2010 and 2011 for examples, Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and 15 October 2011 Global Protests successfully
      conveyed their faith and ideal, connected their supporters, and recorded their campaigns (Conover et al).
      At the start of 2011, local rebels swamped to fight against autocratic governments in Tunisia and Egypt,
      and called for democratic changes. Their local governments and press considered the rebels rioters and
      terrorist. However, the rebel leaders largely posted their appeals and goals through Twitter and Facebook.
      Their posts spread out efficiently around the world, and successfully received a lot of supporters. Western
      countries and the press had been giving the protests a lot of attention to the positive effect of social media
      and mobile information technology advocating the successful revolutions termed as Arab Spring. Similarly,
      Occupy Wall Street and 15-October-2011 Global Protests also took advantage of the same method to achieve
      their goals. Although they barely earned any practical concession, they successfully got publicity and
      expressed their thoughts by posting their activities on social media. "These antecedents have in common
      with Occupy Wall Street a reliance on social media and electronic messaging" (Conover et al). In others
      words, more available information from social media and mobile technology inspires people, changes their mind,
      and helps them develop critical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on globalization of digital media, the development of social networking and smart phone
      technology and influences of these technologies on political changes, the information age began in 2000s.
      After 2000s, people are able to share more information in a more efficient way. The information they get from
      those information technologies not only change the way they live their lives, but also change the way they
      think about the world. Since people have made such big changes, the special time span of the 2000s is appears
      to be the beginning of the information age.
