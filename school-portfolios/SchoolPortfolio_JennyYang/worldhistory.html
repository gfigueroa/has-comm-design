    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand cause World War I. According to the political
      cartoon, countries presented by people are chasing one after another. When Serbia was attacked by Austria,
      Russia come and attacked Austria, then Germany came after to attack Russia and so on. This shows the
      relationship between countries and how it lead to a war. (Doc.1) In a letter written to british by Emperor
      Wilhelm II, shows the relationship between Britain and Germany and how terrible Germany grow its navy in order
      to protect itself since Germany think that the England watched to fight against them and no longer keep the
      peace. (Doc.2) Also, the weapons are another reason. The spent of money on weapons which could shows the power
      of a country is increase. Especially for the Germany and British increase the money spent of a large number
      shifting shows they wanted to grow their navy for fight. The fight can help them determine which side get the
      strongest power (Doc.6)

    <p id="question"; style="font-size: 20px;">
      <b> 2. Why were chemical weapons used in World War I?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Chemical weapons used in WWI because the chemical weapons are more easily to harm people.
      According to a British nurse, "They cannot be bandaged or touched …,"" the soldiers who has been gassed cannot
      been treated because their skin are burned. (Doc G) But the area that affected by the poison gas were very
      huge because of the spreading smoke. (Doc D) According to Ferfuson, a British army commander, he thinks that
      the way they can win the war, is to kill more people than enemies. And he thinks that this can only done by
      "copying the enemy in his choice of weapons," because chemical weapons are more harmful. (Doc I) Last but not
      least, in document F, the ratio of soldiers wounded from gas to those killed by gas are 4 times bigger than the
      ratio of soldiers wounded from non-gas weapons to those killed from non-gas weapons. It shows that the chemical
      weapons are more efficient in harming people. (Doc F)
