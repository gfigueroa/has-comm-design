    <h3>The other sniper</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; During the bitter civil war in Ireland, people split into two sides. One side were the Republicans and the
      other side were the Free Staters. Liam was belonged to the Free Staters because he wanted to be stronger and
      more powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; One day, rifles and bullet broke up the peace of Dublin. Republicans and Free Staters started to fight the
      civil war. Liam was lying on the roof and observing of surrounding environment. He was also chatting with his
      ally. Suddenly, Liam saw a light from the opposite side of the street and he smelled something different.
      "Someone is smoking over there," said Liam. So he tried to raise his rifle and shoot the smoke. But he did
      not hit the smoker successfully. There was only a flash of light and the bullet flew over the smoker's head.
      Liam felt disgust and sad because fail the shoot. He really wanted to kill the person who was smoking, no matter
      he or she was. Because he knew that was his enemy. Then, he tried to hide himself because he let the smoker run
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Just then Liam heard an engine sound. He lifted his head and saw that an armored car came across the bridge.
      The armored car came closer and closer to him and then it advanced slowly up to cover him. He did not know what
      is going on and who is in the armored car. So he came forward and checked. He saw that there were several people
      wearing the same clothes which meant to Liam that they were on the same side with him in the car. Soon, he
      realized that they were his allies. Liam tried to walk forward to see if there were more allies. He walked and
      walked and then he sat down beside a parapet. An old woman was walking close to him and then she sat down beside
      him and began to talk to Liam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly, the old woman was pointing at the roof and told Liam to look carefully. Liam was shocked because the
      place the old woman was pointing was where Tom, the Republican's was laying in. Just in that moment, the old woman
      was shot by the rifle. She fell down quickly and unfortunately she soon stopped breathing. Liam was so angry
      because he knew it was the sniper from other side. And that means his new ally was killed by his enemy. So Liam
      picked up his rifle quickly and tried to find the other sniper. Then he found something was moving behind the
      pole. He saw the other sniper's head and shoulders appear. Then he fired at him immediately. Suddenly, Liam shot
      the other sniperâ€™s arm. The other sniper could not hold his rifle because his arm started bleeding. "Ouch!" Tom
      shouted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, it is the late afternoon. The sun goes down and the moon rises. Liam thought that he might be
      safe now, so he decided to take a rest on the roof and also wait for tomorrow morning. Liam was very exhausted
      because he just finished fighting with his enemy. He was eating a bread hungrily because he did not eat
      anything for five days. When he finish eating, he just lay down and fell into sleep quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; The next morning, the sun came up. Liam was woke up with people's noisy sound. He stretch his arm and yawn,
      it might be too early too get up. Then he looked around to do the final confirmation. If there haven't any
      different then he can finish his mission and go home. Suddenly, he saw a cap over a rifle above the parapet.
      He did not think too much, he think that must be the other sniper and he wanted revenge. So he sight the cap
      and shot again. Then, the cap falling down to the street and he heard a rifle, clattering down to the ground.
      Liam thought that he had killed the enemy. So he stood up with a smile of joy. But suddenly, he saw the other
      sniper appeared in front of him. And they have an eye match with other. But Liam could not notice who the other
      sniper was because both of them wear mask. The next second, Boom! A bullet when through Liam's body. He got shot
      by the other sniper. Then Liam just realized he was tricked. His blood began to flow from his face to his pocket
      and then his foot. His rifle was fell from his hand and hit the parapet. Liam whirled round and fell down on the
      roof. Then the other sniper taking of his mask and walked closer to Liam. "Goodbye," the other sniper said to Liam.
      And he toward Liam's head and shot to him. Liam was so regret in that moment. Because in this moment, Liam
      realized that the other sniper is his brother, Tom. Liam regret that he wanted to killed the person who was
      smoking opposite of the street, he regret the old woman's death also he regret he participate in the war. But
      it was too late. Soon, Liam stopped to breath. And he was dead.
