			<strong>Course description: </strong>
           The college essay matters. Your essay reveals something important about you that your grades and test scores can't—your personality. It can give admission officers a sense of who you are, as well as showcasing your writing skills.

        <h1>Study Plan:</h1>
        
        <p id="essay">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout my high school life, I learned and tried out many different things. Various types of subjects help me develop the basic skills that I need, help me prepare for college, and determine what to study in the future as well. However, I spent two years studying abroad. The reasons that I chose to study abroad were because I wanted to try new things, learn new languages, experience different views and cultures of other countries, and have an adventure on my own. The experiences and failures that I learned from studying abroad have helped me understand the outside world and how I have to improve myself to be able to prepare for my future.</p>
          
	       <p id="essay">&nbsp; &nbsp;In high school, I tried out many different subjects, and tried to find what type of major I am interested in. However, many ideas went through my mind, such as hotel management, economy, or business management before I really made a decision. After considering many different factors and listening to other people’s experiences, I decided to study engineering. Even though engineering may not be the easiest to study, it is challenging, which makes it stand out from the crowd. Studying engineering, I will also learn a specific set of skills and professions. In my personal opinion, to have a profession is more important than having a lot of knowledge in your brain. In the future, technology and engineering will be the most important to the human race and to the earth as well, and studying engineering will bring more benefit to me and to my future.</p>
          
           <p id="essay">&nbsp; &nbsp;As I decided to study engineering, this is when I chose to study in Germany. Germany's achievements in science and technology have been very significant and well known to the world. I spent one year in my high school as an exchange student in Germany to take my first step to explore the country, culture, and language. However, the result was completely the opposite of what I had imagined. Due to my lack of languages skill and the completely new environment, life in Germany was hard to adjust to. My host family and school were the major problems because of the cultural and language differences; I hardly had any friends and good memories in Germany. The experiences in Germany were a disaster and I had a really hard time.</p>
	        
           <p id="essay">&nbsp; &nbsp;After my arrival back in Taiwan, people who listened to my experience always ask me why I want to go back to Germany even though I did not have a good time there. The exchange year was hard, but it gave me experience for the future and lessons for life. I will not give up just because of my lack of language skill and did not have best time in my exchange year. I started to take language class and studied germen whenever I have time. I set goals and are preparing for language test to improve my language skill. I also began to watch German movies and articles to understand more about the country. Moreover, I see the attitude of how Germans do things. They are strict and straightforward. This is also what makes their technology skills advanced and their country strong. I want learn more about the culture and the country, and also my curiosity toward technology and trying out different things to explore my future.
