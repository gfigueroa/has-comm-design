        <h1>12 Years A Slave: Reading Response</h1>
        
        <p id="essay">
            &nbsp; &nbsp;Solomon Northup’s “12 Years A Slave” is based on a true story recounts the author’s life. The setting is took place in 1841 of the United State, a story of his life as a free black man got kidnapped and sold into the slavery pre-Civil War South. His dramatic stories about his life affected many people, even now, his story helped share the awareness of slavery and still mean a lot to the society. Throughout the 11 chapters we had read so far, I saw what the society was back then, and felted emotional by his used of words and tone.</p>

             &nbsp; &nbsp;Solomon Northup wrote this novel after 12 year of slavery when he regained his freedom. At the time, I believed his audience is toward the white man, black slave and people who support the slave trade, especially the South also as well to the society. According to Northup, in the beginning of Chapter 6, he used sarcasm to describe the cruelty of a slave trader Theophilus Freeman. “ The very amiable, pious- hearted Mr. Theophilus Freeman” (48.) Northup listed the slave trader’s awful, including kicking old women or whip the young children. His used of sarcasm described how Freeman treated them like “animals.” “ Mr. Theophilus Freeman bustled about in a very industrious manner, getting his property ready for the sales-room” (Northup 48.) The purpose is to express his anger toward the inhumanly act of a white man calling his slave “animal” and his “property,” he is also accusing those who support the slave trade at the time.</p>

             &nbsp; &nbsp;Northup later try to tell the cold-hearted truth and reality, the description of the separation of Eliza’s family is really heartbreaking and emotional. The slave trader Freeman’s action and cruelty of refused to sell Emily prove his evilness and the darkness of the humanity. “He would not sell her then on any account whatever, there were heaps and piles of money to be made other, he said, when she was few years older” (Northup 55.) Rather than keep mother and daughter together, Freeman act differently and inhumanly, he will keep Emily until she is sexually mature and earn more money. Northup use sarcasm, language, mood, and tone to show the hard truth of the reality. He is basically making a point of that slavery will harm both white man and black slave morally and its humanity.</p>
          <p id="essay">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;According to Northup, a slave trader had changed his name randomly to “Platt” which they tried to get rid of the evidence that he is a free man. However, by not just telling how slavery can change a human being, he is also reminding other blacks to keep fighting for their freedom, even though it was a hard road, but remember who you are, fight for what you believed, and gained your liberty. “ I asserted, aloud and boldly, that I was a free man”(20.)</p>
