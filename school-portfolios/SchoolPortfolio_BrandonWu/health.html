        <h1>What to eat?</h1>
        
        <p id="essay">
        1.	What can I eat to not get sick?
            &nbsp; &nbsp;
            I found to articles about foods that can prevent sickness. The first article was about how vitamin D is really important to your body. Human can get vitamin D from sunlight and from food such as salmon, and fortified milk. However, according to research, kids who take vitamin D daily are less likely to get flu virus. The second articles give 6 different types of food that are healthy for your body and can help prevent sickness. For example, fresh clementine provide good source of vitamin C. It can help cut down on the duration and severity of colds. Also, according to the website, soluble fiber—abundant in citrus fruits, apples, carrots, beans and oats—helps fight inflammation.
            The clip video I found is talking about way to fight disease and cold. Protein is needed when fighting diseases. One of jobs of protein is to help your body to fight off disease. Vitamins C and flavonoids also help your body turn out to protective immune cells. Furthermore, People who drink five cups of black tea daily produce 10 times more violence fighting interfere on than coffee drinkers. This can applied to my life because I can get stronger body changing my eating habit. Also can help me workout and get stronger.</p>
