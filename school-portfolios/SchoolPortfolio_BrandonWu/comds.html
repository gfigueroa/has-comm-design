			<strong>Course description: </strong>
           The 2016-2017 Communication Design course will help to prepare students for the presentation and graphical project assignments that they will encounter during their high school and university studies. This course will encompass different skills and disciplines required for the human communication process, particularly with the use of technology and software tools. The main focus of this course is the planning, design, creation, and maintenance of digital media, including websites, images, audio, and video. There is a heavy emphasis on actual production, which is assessed through individual and group projects, as well as daily hands-on work.

        <p id="essay">
             &nbsp; &nbsp;In this week communication design class, the most persuasive argument introduced is how some details in a website can effect the quality of a website. This weeks classwork relate to our daily life since the Internet is now all over us, and it is important to determine weather a website is good or bad. There is nothing that I disagree in class this week, since the good and bad of a website is really easy to see. The most important point concept or concept this week will be the feature on how to create a website, such as the balance or color uses in the website. If I can redo this week concept, I will probably think more about the rubric details and how will the website be graded.
