			<strong>Course description: </strong>
           This introductory course is designed for students with little or no previous study of Spanish. Some students in class might have studied Spanish in middle school, but have not grasped some of the important structures of the language. This course teaches basic language patterns and vocabulary. Repetition and comprehensible input are important components of this course. Focus is on all four language skills listening, speaking, reading and writing. Culture is an integral part of the course and is introduced through the use of media, games, adapted readings and class discussions. In addition to written tests and quizzes, students may also be assessed by means of aural activities. Homework assignments are an integral part of this course; they reinforce concepts/skills introduced and explored in class, which enable students to participate in class in a meaningful way. Completion of homework assignments is a must. Active participation is required.
