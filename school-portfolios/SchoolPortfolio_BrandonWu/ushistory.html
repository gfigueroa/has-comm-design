			<strong>Course description: </strong>
           This course will cover United States history from its pre-colonial period beginning in c. 1492 to the present. It covers all major aspects of American history during that period including: political, diplomatic, intellectual, cultural, economic and social. In addition, the course deals extensively with learning how to read, understand, analyze and interpret a wide variety of both primary and secondary texts together with the maps, graphs and pictorial materials associated with them. The course also aims to help students to put the knowledge and understanding they are gaining into practice through sharpening their oral and written communication skills. This will be achieved in two ways: First, through regular class discussions and occasional assigned oral presentations or debates. Second, through the regular writing of focused essays that require both knowledge and analytical and interpretive skills. Though challenging, this course is extremely important in understanding the United States of America as it exists in the world today. Students will be rewarded in a myriad of ways for the effort they put into it. Finally, if the past is any guide to the present – and I believe that you will learn that it is – this course will be one of the most enjoyable and beneficial that you will ever take in your high school career.
