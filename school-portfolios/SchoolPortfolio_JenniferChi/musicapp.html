			<p>
				This class was an elective class In this class, we discussed different music
				genres throughout history. We started the year off by learning about the Medival
				genre and the Classical genre. Afterwards, we began to get into more modern genres
				such as jazz, rock and roll, and pop. With each genre, we were taught about its 
				historical background, how it influenced certain cultures, and how we felt about
				the genres. For each class, we usually had to write journals on how we felt about 
				the music that we were listening to. Also, for each class, we usually listened to 
				at least one song from the genre we were currently learning to understand what that 
				music sounded like.
