			<h2>Teacher: Mr. Figuroa</h2>
		
			<p>
				In communication design, we learned about how to code in both HTML and CSS. 
				The main goal of the class is to learn how to create a good website from 
				scratch. We learned about the qualities of a good website, such as consistency
				in design and how to ake a webaite visually appealing. We also learned about 
				how to make our website acessible to everyone, taking into account people who are 
				disabled. We used Codecademy, a coding site, to help us learn about the basics
				of coding in HTML and CSS. In addition, we learned the basics of coding by copying what Mr. Figuroa 
				would type up on the projecter or going onto the Washington website. In this class, 
				we usually have homework that requires us to code at home or projects that require us
				to code something from scratch. Also, we fill out weekly journals where we talk
				about that week's classes.
