			<h2>Teacher: Mr.Kerr</h2>
		
			<p>
				This class prepared us for AP Calculus.In this class, we learned 
				the basics of calculus and reviewed some algebraic basics. We were 
				able to cover some calculus topics such as 
				limits and derivatives. For the class, were we usually given a 
				lecture and then assigned problems to do. Then, we were assigned 
				homework to do. We were graded on the tests and quizzes that we took.

				Below are some images relating to this class.
