			<h2>Teacher: Mr.Pohlman</h2>
		
			<p>
				This course is a college-level class. In AP Calculus AB, we studied
				the application of differentiation and integration and how to analyze 
				a graph by determining a graph's limits, asymptotes, and continuity. 
				Each class we are given a lecture on one or more sections of our textbook. 
				After the lecture, we are given problems to practie and homework to do. 
				A lot of the class tieme consists of doing mathematical problems and asking \
				questions. We are also give tests and quizzes to test our abilities. 
				<br />
				Below are some images relating to this class.
