			<p>
				 College essay is a class that only seniors cn sign up for. In class, we work
				 on our college applications; this includes essays, recommendation letters, and
				 applying for scholarships. The teachers give everyone "assignments", such as 
				 finishing one essay and requesting one application letter, to make sure that 
				 everyone is on the write track for application and that no one is procrastinating. 
				 Usually, we are given a lot of free time to work on teh things that we need to get 
				 down. After everyone has submitted their applications, which will be around the second 
				 semester, the teachers will start to teach "life lessons" like how to do taxes 
				 or apply for residency.
