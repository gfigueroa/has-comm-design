			<h2>Teacher: Mrs. Derdiger</h2>
		
			<p>
				This class is an advanced dystopian novel class. In class, we read
				and discuss dystopian novels. So far, we have read "The Hunger Games"
				by Suzanne Collins, "Anthem" by Ayn Rand, and "Do Androids Dream of 
				Electric Sheep" by Phillip K. Dick. For each novel that we read, we 
				learn about certain themes within the novel and we analyze the plot 
				and characters of the novel. In addition, we are alo required to give 
				a certain amount of presentations for each novel where we discuss 
				more themes, plot points, and any information that relates to the novel. 
				We are graded on our reading responses, journals, presentations, and 
				discussions that we have in class. 
				<br />
				Below are some images of a presentation I did in this class.
