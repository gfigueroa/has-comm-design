			<h2>Teacher: Mr. Pohlman</h2>
		
			<p>
				This course is a college-level class. While AP statistics is
				considered a math class, most of the lessons that we are taught are
				based more on conceptual understanding and interpretation. In class, 
				we discuss how to analyze different distributions of data, how to plan
				and conduct a study, and how to approah information using probability and 
				statistical inference. The class is very structured, During class, we are 
				given a lecture abou the topic that we are learning. Then, we are given 
				practice problems to do in class and homework to do at home. We are graded
				on tests, quizzes and homework.
