			<h2>Teacher: Mr. Witte</h2>
		
			<p>
				This class was a college-level class. In class, we learned about
				the cultural, economic, political, and social developments in
				European history, from the year 1450 to the present, that 
				have shaped todays world. For the class, we usually had to read 
				around a chapter per class to prepare for the material being taught. 
				In class, we took quizzes on recently learned information and held
				discussions about the information. We also had many AP mock tests 
				where we had to write essays and short answers analyzing and 
				interpreting historical information. 
				<br />
				Below are some images of topics that I learned about in this class.
