			<h2>Teacher: Mr. Donnelly</h2>
		
			<p>
				This class was a college-level class. This class focused on English
				literature and composition. In class, we read a variety of novels
				and short stories, such as "The Handmaids Tale" and "Norwegian Wood", 
				and discussed the meaning of each piece of literature. We usually 
				discussed the plot of the novels/ short stories and analyzed certain 
				symbols within the novel and what they author was trying to convey. We also 
				had to write a variety of essays to prepare for the AP exam. For homework, 
				we were usually assigned to write a reading response on the novel/
				short story. 
				<br />
				Below are some images of my work in this class.
