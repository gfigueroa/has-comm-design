			<h2>Teacher: Mr.Chu</h2>
		
			<p>
				In this class, we were taught the basics of economics. We were
				taught how to determine the factors associated with the production and
				distribution of products, how buyers and sellers interact in the
				marketplace, and the different types of market structures. In economics, 
				we were taught both microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics
				is the part of the economy having to do with single factors and the effects
				of individual decision. Macroeconomics deals with the economy as a whole. In 
				class, we held discussions and listened to lectures. We were graded on projects
				and tests.

				Below are some imgaes of a project I did in this class.
