			<h2>Teacher: Mrs. Kruger</h2>
		
			<p>
				In this class, we focused on painting and drawing. In class, we created
				works of art that adhered to an artistic element, principle, or 
				theme. For example, for one of our pieces, we had to focus on painting
				or drawing two pieces that related to a theme that we came up with. For
				this project, my theme was "feet", so I created two pieces that related to
				feet. In addition to projects, we also had written works where we had to 
				write about how we could improve on our pieces. After each completed piece, 
				we had a class discussion about each of our pieces where we had to talk 
				about our idea and help others improve on their ideas. 
				<br />
				Below are some images of a project I did in this class.
