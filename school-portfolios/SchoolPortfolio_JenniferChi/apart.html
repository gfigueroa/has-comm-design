			<h2>Teacher: Mrs. Kruger</h2>
		
			<p>
				In AP studio art, we focus on creating works of art that incorporate the principles and elements 
				of design. In AP studio art, students can choose to focus on drawing, 2-D design, or 3-D design. 
				I have chosen to focus on 3-D design. In class, we are usually given a short lesson on a specific
				topic that we're talking about like the use of pattern in art or how to experiment with diferent
				materials. Then, we are given a sketchbook homework and an assignment to complete within the next
				couple of days. Usually, we get class time to work on our projects. Some of the projects that we have 
				done so far involved creating a piece of clothing using an unusual material and creating a costume 
				design. After we finish a project, we come together as a class and share what we have worked on 
				and earn feedback. We are graded on the quality of our work, our sketchbooks, and our participation.
				<br />
				Below are some images of a project I did in this class.
