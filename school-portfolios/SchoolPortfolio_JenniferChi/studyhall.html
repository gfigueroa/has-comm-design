			<h2>Advisor: Mrs. Kruger</h2>
		
			<p>
				Study hall isn't a course so much as it is a time for me to catch
				up on my work. Study hall takes place every A Day and is eighty 
				minutes long. My study hall doesn't have a teacher, but an advisor
				who watched over us. In study hall, I usually do my homework, extra 
				work from class, or college applications. Sometimes, if I get too tired 
				to do anything, I will take a nap. There are no grades, tests, quizzes, 
				or homework for study hall.
