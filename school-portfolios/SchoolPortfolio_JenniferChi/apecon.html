			<p> 
				This course is a college-level economics class. In AP Economics, 
				we learned about the different factors, competition, and markets that make up
				an economy. For example, we learned about how, in a competitive market, 
				the price of goods and services is pushed by the "invisible hand" and how
				consumers and producers make up the entirety of a market. In addition, we 
				had many in class discussions about the economy in our current world and the
				different types of markets that make up our current world. To further our
				understanding, we were given a multitude of exams and worksheets that asked us
				questions based on information we had learned in a certain time period.

				Below are some images of a study guide I made to prepare for a test.
