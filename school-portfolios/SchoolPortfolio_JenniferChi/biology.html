			<p>
				In class, we were taught about life and living organisms. This 
				included how organisms are structured, their function, their,
				growth, and their evolution. In addition, we covered topics such as 
				molecular biology, cell biology, anatomy, and genetics. During class, we
				were usually given a lecture and worksheets to do. We were graded on tests,
				quizzes, homework, and projects. Also, we did a few labs where we were asked
				a question and we had to find the answer using the scientific method. 
				<br />
				Below are some images of a science fair project I did in this class.
