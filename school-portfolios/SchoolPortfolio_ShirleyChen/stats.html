        <h3><em>Class:</em> Statistics</h3>
        <h3><em>Teacher:</em> Mr. Pohlman</h3>
        <h3><em>Project Name:</em> Final Project</h3>
				<h4><em>Course Description:</em> Students will work with probability, data collection,
          descriptive and inferential statistics, probability, and technological tools to analyze
          statistics. The main foci of the course will be exploring data, planning a study, producing
          models using probability theory, and making statistical inferences. Students will work with
          statistical measures of centrality and spread, methods of data collection, methods of determining
          probability, binomial and normal distributions, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals.
          Students will use multiple representations to present data including written descriptions,
          numerical statistics, formulas, and graphs.
