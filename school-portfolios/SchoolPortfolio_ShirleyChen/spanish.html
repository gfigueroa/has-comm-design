        <h3><em>Class:</em> Spanish 1</h3>
        <h3><em>Teacher:</em> Mr. Figueroa</h3>
        <h3><em>Project Name:</em> Me familia</h3>
				<h4><em>Course Description:</em> Spanish 1 will provide the student with a general introduction
					to the Spanish language: sound system, pronunciation, functional vocabulary related to everyday
					life, cultural information and basic grammatical structures. Emphasis will be on the acquisition
					of four skills: listening, speaking, reading and limited writing. There are two main objectives to
					the course. Foremost is to give the students the ability to carry on a simple conversation.
					The second is to provide the students with instruction that teaches a basic understanding of
					Spanish culture, vocabulary, and grammatical concepts.
