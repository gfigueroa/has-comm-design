        <h3><em>Project Name:</em> Science Fair</h3>
				<h4><em>Course Description:</em> Physics is an advanced level science class that satisfies
					the high school graduation requirement of a physical science class. Students should have
					successfully completed or currently enrolled in Accelerated Math III. The physics curriculum
					includes interactions of matter and energy, velocity, accelerations, force, energy, momentum
					and charge. Students will be challenged to apply their knowledge of the laws of physics to solve
					physics related critical thinking problems. Students will complete a long term science project that
					will count as multiple test and projects grades for each nine week grading period. Students are also
					required to read an outside novel as part of the Common Core Reading standards for science.
