			<p>
				In the space station, the guards tried to trap me. I didn’t know why they want to catch me, so I was very nervous. I hit them and run out of the jail quickly. After I got out of the guards, I met my mom and she protected me. However, there are some bad things happened, I got anestheize by a man and I was faint.

			<p>
				When I woke up, I was in a spaceship. I didn’t know where this ship was going. There were lots of people sit here with me, we all sitting in this ship except a person. He was floating around in our spaceship. He was an ugly guy who always wanted to be cool. When he was floating happily, our ship got out of control. Our ship flew messily. It was really crazy, that floating person was hit by our ship.  Because he was not in his seat. After this huge terrible accident, we arrived at Earth. A moment later, a girl with black hair went out to the Earth, her name is Octavia. And then, we all went out. However, I though here was really strange that I decided to go on an exploring! I wanted to find what make me confuse.

				We have five people to explore this island.  After we walked around here about an hour, we saw an organism; it was a lovely deer. By the way, it was so cute, and I was going to cry for it because it means the environment of Earth can exist for animals. But some weird things happen, when the deer turn its head to my side, it has two faces! It was really scared that made me think more about here. We kept going and took a little break.

				When I woke up at the midnight, I saw lots of blue little light, I didn’t know what they were but I thought they were lovely, and I went back to sleep. When everybody woke up, it was morning, we went to a river bank and Octavia jumped into the water, the water looks clear and safe at first. But when she was washing her body, there came a black shadow, a really huge, black thing. It trapped Octavia and tried to hurt her! Fortunately, Jasper jumped into the water to saved her and I cure her legs. After a while, we went to next place. We saw the other side but there was a canyon between here. Finn finished robbing the rope and Jasper went there handsomely because he wanted Octavia to look at him. He did it so well, but when we were going to go there, he shot by something we don’t know. Then, we hide under a big rock and tried to save ourselves we were nervous and scared.
