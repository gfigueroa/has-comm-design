			<p class="title">Why Animal Farm Fail?</p>
	<p>In the Animal Farm, the revolution was failing in the end of the story, but why it wasn’t success? Let’s see. </p>
	<p>Why some people want the power? What could power give us? Why some people want to have freedom? Does freedom and power relative? The power is good? Or having freedom is good? If there have one person and he or she has all the power, what will it happens? If that happened, is that positive or negative? The power can totally own in one person hand?</p>
	<p>As long as we have read Animal Farm, we could see that the Animal Farm didn’t actually won. They wanted to wish the Old Major’s goal, they tried to make up these all the problems in Animal Farm. But they didn’t, they fail this revolution. They fail it because of many different reasons. Maybe the reason why they fail is leader’s problem, or it is because the animals didn’t take attention to what leader was saying? There have many reasons why they fail the Animal Farm. </p>
	<p>In fact, in our real live. The leader can influence a group of people a lot because people have to do what leader said. That lets leader become very important of a group. Some leader will get worse of the power that they could decide lots of things. That prove if you get a good leader that almost means you win half of what you want to do. Otherwise, if the group get a bad leader, or the leader who actually just “say” but doesn’t really “work” that may be means that group is in the huge problem for failing the game or election.</p>
	<p>Why did Animal Farm fail the revolution? At the beginning, they were really successful and they were still grow, they work together, they fought for themselves to get what they wanted, they were absolutely working-hard. However, in Animal Farm we can directly saw that pigs were cheating on every animal in the farm just from the very beginning, they let themselves to become the best group of the Animal Farm. They said they are the best, pigs are the smartest, they are the leader, they need more foods, more rest and they can rule everything.</p>
	<p>But they still said that animals should be equal! When they said they are the head of the animals. Meanwhile, this sentence is already unequal for other animals.</p>
	<p>So I think the biggest problem of Animal Farm is that they had a bad leader to lead all of the animals. First of all, the leader “group” of the Animal Farm was pigs, because the animal which began the revolution was Old Major. Old Major is a pig but before the revolution he had died. When the revolution really began that the leader of the Animal Farm undoubtedly logical are pigs. </p>
	<p>In that pigs group, they have two major leader which are Snowball and Napoleon, but Napoleon just thinking of the power that can lets him get the money and what he wants. Unfortunately, Snowball was being expelled from the farm. The reason why he was expelled was because Napoleon thought that Snowball will let him can’t be the king of the Animal Farm.</p>
	<p>As you know, the leader who will kick somebody else out is always not very a good leader, to be a leader of group you have to can accept other people; this is the basic rule of being a good leader. But Napoleon didn’t do that, he still drive Snowball out of the Animal Farm. He wanted to take all the power of the leadership. I think it is a mainly problem that Animal Farm was failed. </p>
	<p>On the other hand, we could think about if in the beginning of the Animal Farm, the leader group was horses instead of pigs? Will the situation become greater or the situation will become same worse as the original why Animal Farm failed? There will have a lot of different continues situations if this happen.</p>
	<p>First, I think if the Boxer became the leader, he will work hard. He will be a hard-working animals even harder than other animals, in the story we could see that Boxer was really hard-working, he built almost whole windmill that prove he was really a good person that is a good choice to let he be the leader of Animal Farm.</p>
	<p>Second, “‘Fools! Fools!’ shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. ‘Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?’ That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read: “‘Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon. Dealer in Hides and Bone-Meal. Kennels Supplied’ Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker’s””. </p>
	<p>According to this paragraph we could find that animals love Boxer a lot, when he was going to send to the place where can “process” the corpse of animals. All the animals don’t want him to go there! Some of them even shout out loud to him that he didn’t want his friend to be the clothes of humans.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile, we can see the pigs were so mean that they sent Boxer to the factory. What were they wanted? They just want money, money, and money. Napoleon just wanted money that he can buy wine and having more and more fun. This is a good reason why Napoleon was not a good leather of Animal Farm. </p>
	<p>As we saw in the story and what I just said, if horses were the leader of the Animal Farm, Boxer and Benjamin will be the two good leaders! But if horses were the leaders of the farm, we have to consider about Molly, too. She didn’t understand any English and any words, she kept combing her hair and actually didn’t do lots of works. Maybe she will do the same things as Napoleon did, she might be greedy as Napoleon.</p>
	<p>In this situation we could see that everyone has their own desires that they will want to get it. In this case, maybe there should not has a leader group. The animals should work together and they can have regular meeting for per weeks, and decide either what to do in the next week or to do some improvement for the farm. </p>
	<p>In the story, we absolutely saw that the pigs were really greedy that they didn’t work and they just wanted the money and wanted to be richer. </p>
