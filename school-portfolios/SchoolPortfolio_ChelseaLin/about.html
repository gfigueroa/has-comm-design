                <div> <p> &nbsp &nbsp Located in scenic Hsinchu, the Silicon Valley of Taiwan, one of the leading knowledge-based economies of Asia, our school has emerged as the only fully licensed international school to grade 12 in the area, due to the concerns from the professional community for an international school that can meet as well as exceed the expectations of the global community represented here.</p>
                <p> &nbsp &nbsp Hsinchu American School is a co-educational and college preparatory international school licensed by Taiwan Ministry of Education and by Hsinchu Education Bureau serving grades 1 through 12. It is registered with the American Institute in Taiwan and is in the process of accreditation with the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.</p>

                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp Nestled in the National Art Park, the school is surrounded by a scenic 21,500 sq. meter (6,500 pings) campus with newly renovated and state-of-the-art facilities for student achievement.</p>

                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp Our classrooms are loaded with projector screens and wireless internet access. The spacious atrium in the middle of the building offers a safe environment for a diversity of indoor activities and celebrations. The sculpture park and the coming fine arts museum in the National Art Park provide an environment to nurture studentsâ€™ appreciation of arts and promote their artistic creativity.</p>

                    <p> &nbsp &nbsp With our outstanding faculty, Hsinchu American School offers students the opportunity for Advanced Placement with an AP preparatory program from the 6th Grade. The school curriculum is based on the U.S. national McRel Standards, designed for university-bound students in the United States.</p>
