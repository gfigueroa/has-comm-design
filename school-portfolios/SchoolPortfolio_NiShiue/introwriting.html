	Have you ever got most improved at something in your life? Like you are horrible at the start, but after that, you do a fantastic job in the end. That's called improvement. This is a story of my first year at Hsinchu American School where I learned that if you work hard, then you can defeat anything.<br/><br/>
	In the beginning of that school year, I went to HAS, the first day of my middle school. I got problems after one week. My English was as bad as a baby, so teacher suggested me to downgrade to 6th grade. But I answered back strongly to my teacher, "No!"<br/><br/>
	Suddenly, I began to work hard everyday. I started getting better in the class. I found a tutor to improve my English. If I had problems or questions, my mom taught me how to do homework. My grades like an air plane flew up to the sky. It was unbelievable!<br/><br/>
	The teacher started to think I was not a student that should be put in the 6th grade. It was amazing for me. When the teacher talked to my mom, I often heard the good things, such as "Ni is very good." or "Look at this score, it is awesome." etc. When teacher asked questions, I often raised my hand to answer. I felt great.<br/><br/>
	However, in the about the end of school year, it meant the final exams were coming. But I was not frightened, because I studied very hard. My brain only filled by the answers of study guides. I hoped I would be fine on the finals.<br/><br/>
	In conclusion, my scores of final exams were posted on Canvas. I earned some A's in finals. It's way better than my first semester finals. I felt like a different person. I got some C's in the first semester, but not anymore. I got about three A's on second semester finals. In the last day of the school year, I got most improved student award. So, it's possible to break the door to get to a miracle if you work hard. And that is how you get most improved student in the year.</p>
