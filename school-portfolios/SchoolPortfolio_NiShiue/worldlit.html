This essay is going to talk about the failure of the Manor Farm, (before the animals change the name of the farm). The struggle for power is avoidable if the leader is very or too powerful, and I can blame Mr. Jones and Napoleon for causing the decline of the Animal Farm. Since they are the leaders of the farm.
	Mr. Jones is the owner of the Animal Farm, but he is not rich, he has trouble with money, so he likes to drink alcohol, which makes him often forgot to take care and to feed his animals in his farm. “Mr. Jones, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes.” (Orwell 1). As we know, if an owner does not feed his animals, animals will be angry, and they are, in the story. So the animals decide and are going to overthrow Mr. Jones from the farm. However, sad thing happens, it’s Old Major’s death. Mr. Jones is relate to the failure of the Animal Farm, because he makes himself being overthrown, and leads to pigs’ failure at ruling the Animal Farm, they start because of Mr. Jones.<br/>
	Old Major died before the revolution of overthrowing Mr. Jones. Before the death of Old Major, he teached animals about the Animalism, which is that animals are, and should be equal in the farm. Leader died, who is leading now? “(they) were two young boars named Snowball and Napoleon.” (Orwell 10-11). Napoleon is a strong, huge pig, and Snowball is a smart pig who is really good speaker. “Napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. Snowball was a more vivacious pig than Napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character.” (Orwell 11) They plan to overthrow Mr. Jones when he is drunk. and of course, another day, Mr. Jones is drunk again. They overthrow him while he is drunk.<br/>
After the overthrown of Mr. Jones, pigs become very powerful, especially Napoleon, he finds a helper Squaler, which is also an amazing speaker for Napoleon. Then, Napoleon beats Snowball and becomes the leader of the farm, also, he changed the name, from Manor Farm to Animal Farm, so right now, the name of the farm is Animal Farm.
	After becoming a leader of the Animal Farm, Napoleon starts to break his rules, which is seven commandments,
 “1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy,
   2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend,
   3. No animal shall wear clothes,
   4. No animal shall sleep in a bad,
   5. No animal shall drink alcohol,
   6. No animal shall kill any other animal,
   7. All animals are equal.” (Orwell 16).
Napoleon becomes worse than Mr. Jones, greedy, and selfish, he even starts to drink alcohol, sleep in the bed, and stand with two legs, animals can’t even determine Napoleon and humans. Animal Farm becomes worse and worse, animals work hard, but not getting enough food, and not equal, pigs become rich, and wealthy. The failure of the Animal Farm has been start!
	As the result, the Animal Farms become very, very badm like a disaster, and the causes of the failure of the Animal Farm are the struggle for power is avoidable if the leader is powerful, like Napoleon, his greediness and selfish breaks the farm. Also, the failure of the Animal Farm, the 2 people that I or we can blame the most are Mr. Jones and Napoleon. First Mr. Jones does not have his responsibility to take care and feed his animals because he is poor and drunk. Second person is Napoleon, he disobeys Old Major’s Animalism and his own seven commandments, we can’t blame Snowball for this one, because he is not the leader of the Animal Farm. So, that’s how the power can ruin a leader, a person or an animal, or even a group like the Animal Farm.</p>
