				<p><Strong>Persuasive Speech</Strong></p>
				<p>Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, today I will be talking to you about how dancing can create several beneficial impacts on a person. First of all, it is uncontroverted that exercising can help maintain body fitness and reduce the risk of having a heart attack, which mainly results from obesity. People should dance at least once a week in order to improve strength and flexibility of their bodies, which helps keep muscles and joints healthy. I have been dancing for several years. After sitting in a chair for a whole day, I am most delighted to attend dancing classes. Every time the class ends, I am reenergized. The sweat refreshes my body, and all the poisonous substances are gone. Continually practicing dancing has kept me from being obese; on top of that, it has really strengthened my body. Can you imagine how many people are suffering from obesity in the world? According to World Health Organization, “In 2014, more than 1.9 billion adults… were overweight. Of these over 600 million were obese” (“Obesity and Overweight.” World Health Organization). These serious health problems, however, can be improved by regular exercise. Some people might say that other sports can also help maintain physical fitness; however, apart from keeping us physically healthy, dancing helps develop creativity and activate your brain. These benefits cannot be found in other sports.</p>
				<p>Dancing can also affect one’s mood. Research from the University of Derby showed that dancing has the power to significantly improve moods. In the experiment, depressed patients were given salsa lessons. Within nine weeks, they were feeling notably happier (“Dancing Makes You Happier and Smarter.” Back to Basic Wellness LLC). According to Tayler Beth Anderson, an Australian dancer, “It’s fun and a form of escape for me. I know a lot of people who have turned to dance for help and healing.” While dancing, our brain releases a hormone called endorphins. Endorphins will reduce our perception of pain and anxiety; therefore, making us psychologically happier. For people who are struggling in their daily life, the most efficient solution is to join a dancing class and regain the feeling of happiness.<p/>
				<p>Additionally, as mentioned previously, dancing can help develop creative skills and build communication skills needed in every profession. The purpose of dancing is to allow a human being to express his/her thoughts and emotions, it is a form of self-expression. Dancers are encouraged to share their thoughts and feelings through dance moves and develop their own unique style of dancing eventually. As stated on Dance-Teacher.org, a website that provides dancing-specific information, “Dance can…help build vital communication skills needed in every profession…and help you meet new people and make friends with people who have similar interests.” Dance classes can help establish friendships between you and the others because they often require dancers to cooperate with different people and to communicate through their body language. Dancing is like a poem in which movements are words expressing passions and ideas.<p/>
				<p>Finally, dancing can help reduce the risk of dementia, a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded that “…dancing were associated with a reduced risk of dementia” (“Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia in the Elderly — NEJM.” New England Journal of Medicine). Dancing is like a battery for your brain, it stimulates the emotional intelligence, activates the kinesthetic intelligence, and sensitizes the musical intelligence all at once, which increases your neural connectivity.<p/>
				<p>Some people might say that they are too busy to dance or they are too clumsy. However, beginners can start watching any dance-teaching-video on YouTube at home, and spend about 30 minutes every night on practicing with the video before sleeping. You do not have to dance as well as a professional dancer, but simply relax and have fun while dancing.<p/>
				<p>To sum up, dancing can make you physically healthier, psychologically happier, and socially more experienced. For those who are interested in finding dance places, just turn to google map and type the words ‘dance classes’. Then, the nearest locations will pop out automatically. Also, you may be motivated by thinking dance as challenges so it will keep you exercising regularly. As the music plays, you have to keep up with the melody and remember a series of movements. There will never be an end in learning all movements, it is all about adapting to different music and learning new postures. Whenever you complete a task, there will always be another waiting for you. Although dancing may seem a bit difficult, it is actually interesting. As you accomplish a hard posture, you gain confidence and a feeling of happiness for your own success, and you will be eager to learn more. Dancing links to a lot of physical, psychological, and social benefits, and it is a cure to heal the wounds far better than any other medications.<p/>
