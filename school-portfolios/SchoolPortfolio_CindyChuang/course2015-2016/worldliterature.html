				<p><Strong>The Other Sniper</Strong></p>
				<p>In the early morning of June, 1920, the sky was covered all over by clouds. A tense atmosphere enveloped the town, Dublin, where one could only hear the sound of shooting. A dense mist with a heavy smell of gunpowder filled in the air. Some empty houses down the street were standing still, but their windows were all shattered into pieces on the road. The civil war between the Republicans and Free Staters had officially started in Ireland.
				<br><br> There was a Free Stater sniper sitting on top of a roof, he was hiding behind a chimney. The sniper held his gun tightly in front of his body in order to prevent the attack from his enemies. He was just a student with no experiences in war, but he knew one thing for sure --- he had to bring back the victory.
				<br><br> His eyes were firm with no hesitation, so cruel and scared, and his face was expressionless, without the slightest relaxation. When he saw the bread and a bottle of water in his pocket, he realized that he had not eaten his breakfast yet. Thus, the sniper decided to eat the bread as fast as he could then went back to monitor his enemy. However, after he took out his breakfast, he stared at it for a long time because it was his brother’s favorite food.
				<br><br> When they were little, he and his brother liked to play like they were engaging in a gunfight. Each time when he won the fight, his brother cried. Then, their mother would comforted his brother by promising him that she would buy his favorite bread for him. Then, that evening they would eat the bread and chat with each other. He was delighted and satisfied whenever his families stayed together because it gave him the warmth of home. It was before the war that everything was so pleasant and joyful, everyone’s face always had a sweet smile……
				<br><br> Suddenly, a gunfire brought the sniper back to reality, there was sweat on his forehead, and he was shocked because his position was identified by his enemy. The sniper then dropped quickly and stayed motionless until the town returned to a silence again.
				<br><br> When the sniper stood up and tried to find his enemy, he saw an armored car stopped in front of a clothes shop. He squatted down to observe the car, then he saw a familiar face appeared on the side of the road. It was his grandmother. His grandmother walked toward the car and pointed to a building where the sniper’s enemy hid; his grandmother was an informer.
				<br><br> When his grandmother was about to leave, a bullet flew directly through her head and the driver as well, they both were killed by the Republican sniper. The Free Stater sniper was stunned, he could not believe that his dearest grandmother was killed. He was resentful at his enemy and wanted to revenge. Thus, he took his gun and placed it on a brick, he raised the barrel to aim at the top of another building. His hands trembled slightly, and his heartbeat was extremely loud, he was very nervous.
				<br><br> The sniper fired three shots successively. He was not sure that his enemy was killed or not, so he hid behind the chimney and monitored his enemy’s behaviors. Nevertheless, his enemy remained still and the silence seemed quite strange.
				<br><br> When the sniper began to suspect that his enemy was already dead, he saw a cap and his enemy’s face appeared upon the parapet of the roof. The mist blurred his eyes, so he could not clearly identify the face. However, when he saw those piercing eyes, he knew immediately that he had seen this face before. The fact left the sniper dumbfounded because the enemy he wanted to kill was his brother. He was hesitating, all sorts of feelings welled up in his heart. The happy memories appeared again, but the images of his grandmother’s corpse and the desire for victory followed. The sniper did not know which was more important, or which should be sacrificed. His thoughts were rather confusing, and several times he took his gun up and then put it down.
				<br><br> When the sniper hesitated, an image appeared unexpectedly in his mind. It was that his mother held his brother on her knees, singing a lullaby. Yes, his mother always favored his brother. Now, a strong jealousy accompanied by an overwhelming desire for victory occupied his heart. The sniper’s face turned cold again, his eyes became ruthless, and nothing was left in his mind but victory. He held the gun against his chest and aimed at the cap, then pressed the trigger.
				<br><br> The sniper saw the cap and a rifle fell into the street and his enemy’s arm hung lifelessly on the parapet. He thought his enemy was killed, so he came out of the back of the chimney to find the corpse. He looked to the sky with a proud smile, he killed his enemy and clinched the victory.
				<br><br> Almost immediately, a bullet flew across the sky toward the Free Stater sniper, he was shot by his enemy. It turned out that the Republican sniper was not shot, it was only a trick.
				<br><br> The Free Stater sniper fell from top of the roof into the street, his body tuned over and over in the midair, and his eyes were close. At the last moment, his desire for victory was totally replaced by fear of death. It was a kind of fear which he had not been able to imagine before; it was a kind of fear from which hundreds of his comrades, and hundreds of his enemies, were suffering each day. The war seemed absurd, a waste of life.</p>
